        <p><br><br>Act One
<br><br>Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead 
<br><br>The Play
Two ELIZABETHANS passing time in a place without any visible character. They are well-dressed - hats, cloaks, sticks and all. Each of them has a large leather money bag. Guildenstern's bag is nearly empty. Rosencrantz's bag is nearly full. The reason being: they are betting on the toss of a coin, in the following manner: Guildenstern <span class="actionstyle brackets">(hereafter '<span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>')</span> takes a coin out of his bag, spins it, letting it fall. Rosencrantz <span class="actionstyle brackets">(hereafter '<!-- <span class="character ros_anchor" id="ros_anchor1"> -->ROS<!-- </span> -->')</span> studies it, announces it as "heads" <span class="actionstyle brackets">(as it happens)</span> and puts it into his own bag. Then they repeat the process. They have apparently been doing it for some time. The run of "heads" is impossible, yet <span class="character ROS">ROS</span> betrays no surprise at all -
he feels none. However he is nice enough to feel a little embarrassed attaking so much money off his friend. Let that be his character note. <span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span><span class="describecharacter">(A traveling actor with his fair share of wits. He speaks of theatre being only about Love, Blood, and Rhetoric. Stating that everything must contain blood, that it is compulsory and that most things end in death. He is often keeping tabs on the young boy Alfred (one of his tragedians).)</span> is well alive to the oddity of it. He is not worried about the money, but he is worried by the implications ; aware but not going to panic about it - his character note.

<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span> spins. <br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span> studies coin.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Heads.
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(He picks it up and puts it in his money bag. The process is repeated.)</span>
Heads.
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(Again.)</span>
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Heads.
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(Again.)</span>
Heads.
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(Again.)</span>
Heads.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span> <span class="actionstyle brackets">(flipping a coin)</span>: There is an art to the building up of suspense.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Heads.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span> <span class="actionstyle brackets">(flipping another)</span>: Though it can be done by luck alone.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Heads.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: If that's the word I'm after.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span> <span class="actionstyle brackets">(raises his head at <span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>)</span>: Seventy-six love.
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(<span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span> gets up but has nowhere to go. He spins another coin over his shoulder without looking at it, his attention being directed at his environment or lack of it.)</span>
Heads.

<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: A weaker man might be moved to re-examine his faith, if in nothing else at least in the law of probability.
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(He slips a coin over his shoulder as he goes to look upstage.)</span>
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Heads.
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(<span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>, examining the confines of the stage, flips over two more coins, as he does so, one by one of course. <span class="character ROS">ROS</span> announces each of them as "heads".)</span>
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span> <span class="actionstyle brackets">(musing)</span>: The law of probability, as it has been oddly asserted, is something to do with the proposition that if six monkeys <span class="actionstyle brackets">(he has surprised himself)</span>... if six monkeys were...
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Game?
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Were they?
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Are you?
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span> <span class="actionstyle brackets">(understanding)</span>: Games. <span class="actionstyle brackets">(Flips a coin.)</span> The law of averages, if I have got this right, means that if six
monkeys were thrown up in the air for long enough they would land on their tails about as often as they would land on their -
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Heads. <span class="actionstyle brackets">(He picks up the coin.)</span>
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Which at first glance does not strike one as a particularly rewarding speculation, in either sense, even without the monkeys. I mean you wouldn't bet on it. I mean I would, but you wouldn't... <span class="actionstyle brackets">(As he flips a coin.)</span> <br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Heads.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Would you? <span class="actionstyle brackets">(Flips a coin.)</span>
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Heads.
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(Repeat.)</span>
Heads. <span class="actionstyle brackets">(He looks up at <span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span> - embarrassed laugh.)</span> Getting a bit of a bore, isn't it?
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span> <span class="actionstyle brackets">(coldly)</span>: A bore?
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Well...
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: What about suspense?
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span> <span class="actionstyle brackets">(innocently)</span>: What suspense?
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(Small pause.)</span>
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: It must be the law of diminishing returns... I feel the spell about to be broken. <span class="actionstyle brackets">(Energising himself somewhat.)</span>
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(He takes out a coin, spins it high, catches it, turns it over on to the back of his other hand, studies the coin – and tosses it to <span class="character ROS">ROS</span>. His energy deflates and he sits.)</span>
Well, it was a even chance... if my calculations are correct.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Eighty-five in a row - beaten the record!
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Don't be absurd.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Easily!
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span> <span class="actionstyle brackets">(angry)</span>: Is the it, then? Is that all?
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: What?
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: A new record? Is that as far as you prepared to go?
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Well...
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: No questions? Not even a pause?
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: You spun it yourself.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Not a flicker of doubt?
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span> <span class="actionstyle brackets">(aggrieved, aggressive)</span>: Well, I won - didn't I?
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span> <span class="actionstyle brackets">(approaches him - quieter)</span>: And if you'd lost? If they'd come down against you, eighty -five times, one after another, just like that?
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span> <span class="actionstyle brackets">(dumbly)</span>: Eighty-five in a row? Tails?
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Yes! What would you think?
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span> <span class="actionstyle brackets">(doubtfully)</span>: Well... <span class="actionstyle brackets">(Jocularly.)</span> Well, I'd have a good look at your coins for a start!
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span> <span class="actionstyle brackets">(retiring)</span>: I'm relieved. At least we can still count on self-interest as a predictable factor... I suppose it's the last to go. Your capacity for trust made me wonder if perhaps... you, alone...
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(He turns on him suddenly, reaches out a hand.)</span> Touch.
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(<span class="character ROS">ROS</span> claps his hand. <br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span> pulls him up to him.)</span>
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(More intensely)</span>: We have been spinning coins together since - <span class="actionstyle brackets">(He releases him almost as violently.)</span> This is
not the first time we spun coins!
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Oh no - we've been spinning coins for as long as I remember.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: How long is that?
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: I forget. Mind you - eighty-five times!
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Yes?
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: It'll take some time beating, I imagine.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Is that what you imagine? Is that it? No fear?
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Fear?
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span> <span class="actionstyle brackets">(in fury - flings a coin on the ground)</span>: Fear! The crack that might flood your brain with light!
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Heads... <span class="actionstyle brackets">(He puts it in his bag.)</span>
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(<span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span> sits despondently. He takes a coin, spins it, lets it fall between his feet. He looks at it, picks it up; throws it to <span class="character ROS">ROS</span>, who puts it in his bag.)</span>
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(<span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span> takes another coin, spins it, catches it, turns it over on to his other hand, looks at it, and throws it to <span class="character ROS">ROS</span>
who puts it in his bag.)</span>
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(<span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span> tales a third coin, spins it, catches it in his right hand, turns it over on to his loft wrist, lobs it in the air,
catches it with his left hand, raises his left leg, throws the coin up under it, catches it and turns it over on to the top of his head, where it sits. <br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span> comes, looks at it, puts it in his bag.)</span>
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: I'm afraid -
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: So am I.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: I'm afraid it isn't your day.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: I'm afraid it is.
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(Small pause.)</span>
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Eighty-nine.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: It must be indicative of something, besides the redistribution of wealth. <span class="actionstyle brackets">(He muses.)</span> List of possible explanations. One: I'm willing it. Inside where nothing shows, I'm the essence of a man spinning double-headed coins, and betting against himself in private atonement for an unremembered past. <span class="actionstyle brackets">(He spins a coin at <span class="character ROS">ROS</span>.)</span>
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Heads.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Two: time has stopped dead, and a single experience of one coin being spun once has been repeated ninety times... <span class="actionstyle brackets">(He flips a coin, looks at it, tosses it to <span class="character ROS">ROS</span>.)</span> On the whole, doubtful. Three: divine intervention,
that is to say, a good turn from above concerning him, cf. children of Israel, or retribution from above concerning me, cf. Lot's wife. Four: a spectacular vindication of the principle that each individual coin spun individually <span class="actionstyle brackets">(he spins one)</span> is as likely to come down heads as tails and therefore should cause no surprise that each individual time it does. <span class="actionstyle brackets">(It does. He tosses it to <span class="character ROS">ROS</span>.)</span>
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: I've never known anything like it!
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: And syllogism: One, he has never known anything like it. Two: he has never known anything to write home about. Three, it's nothing to write home about... Home... What's the first thing you remember?
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Oh, let's see...The first thing that comes into my head, you mean?
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: No - the first thing you remember.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Ah. <span class="actionstyle brackets">(Pause.)</span> No, it's no good, it's gone. It was a long time ago.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span> <span class="actionstyle brackets">(patient but edged)</span>: You don't get my meaning. What is the first thing after all the things you've forgotten? <br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Oh. I see. <span class="actionstyle brackets">(Pause.)</span> I've forgotten the question.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: How long have you suffered from a bad memory? <br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: I can't remember.
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(<span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span> paces.)</span>
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Are you happy?
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: What?
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Content? At ease?
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: I suppose so.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: What are you going to do now?
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: I don't know. What do you want to do?
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: I have no desires. None. <span class="actionstyle brackets">(He stops pacing dead.)</span> There was a messenger... that's right. We were sent
for. <span class="actionstyle brackets">(He wheels at <span class="character ROS">ROS</span> and raps out.)</span> Syllogism the second: one: probability is a factor which operates within natural forces. Two, probability is not operating as a factor. Three, we are now within un-, sub- or supernatural forces. Discuss. <span class="actionstyle brackets">(<span class="character ROS">ROS</span> is suitably startled - Acidly.)</span> Not too heatedly.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: I'm sorry, I - What's the matter with you?
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: A scientific approach to the examination of phenomena is a defence against the pure emotion of fear. Keep tight hold and continue while there's time. Now - counter to the previous syllogism: tricky one, follow me carefully, it may prove a comfort. If we postulate, and we just have, that within un-, sub- or supernatural forces the probability is that the law of probability will not operate as a factor, then we must accept that the
probability of the first part will not operate as a factor, in which case the law of probability will operate as a factor within un-, sub- or supernatural forces. And since it obviously hasn't been doing so, we can take it that we are not held within un-, sub- or supernatural forces after all; in all probability, that is. Which is a great relief to me personally. <span class="actionstyle brackets">(Small pause.)</span> Which is all very well, except that - <span class="actionstyle brackets">(He continues with tight hysteria, under control.)</span> We have been spinning coins together since I don't know when, and in all that time <span class="actionstyle brackets">(if it is all that time)</span> I don't suppose either of us was more than a couple of gold pieces up or down. I hope that doesn't sound surprising because it's very unsurprisingness is something I am trying to keep hold of. The equanimity of your average pitcher and tosser of coins depends upon a law, or rather a tendency, or let us say a probability, or at any rate a mathematically calculable chance, which ensures that he will not upset himself by losing too much nor upset
his opponent by winning too often. This made for a kind of harmony and a kind of confidence. It related the fortuitous and ordained into a reassuring union which we recognised as nature. The sun came up about as often as it went down, in the long run, and a coin showed heads about as often as it showed tails. Then a messenger arrived. We had been sent for. Nothing else happened. Ninety-two coins sun consecutively have come down heads ninety-two consecutive times... and for the last three minutes on the wind of a windless day I have heard the sound of drums and flute...
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span> <span class="actionstyle brackets">(cutting his fingernails)</span>: Another curious scientific phenomenon is the fact that the fingernails grow after death, as does the beard.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: What?
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span> <span class="actionstyle brackets">(loud)</span>: Beard!
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: But you're not dead.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span> <span class="actionstyle brackets">(irritated)</span>: I didn't say they started to grow after death! <span class="actionstyle brackets">(Pause, calmer.)</span> The fingernails also grow before
birth, though not the beard.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: What?
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span> <span class="actionstyle brackets">(shouts)</span>: Beard! What's the matter with you? <span class="actionstyle brackets">(Reflectively.)</span> The toenails, on the other hand, never grow at
all.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span> <span class="actionstyle brackets">(bemused)</span>: The toenails never grow at all?
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Do they? It's a funny thing - I cut my fingernails all the time, and every time I think to cut them, they need
cutting. Now, for instance. And yet, I never, to the best of my knowledge, cut my toenails. They ought to be curled under my feet by now, but it doesn't happen. I never think about them. Perhaps I cut them absent-mindedly, when I'm thinking of something else.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span> <span class="actionstyle brackets">(tensed up by this rambling)</span>: Do you remember the first thing that happen today?
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span> <span class="actionstyle brackets">(promptly)</span>: I woke up, I suppose. <span class="actionstyle brackets">(Triggered.)</span> Oh - I've got it now - that man, a foreigner, he woke us up - <span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: A messenger. <span class="actionstyle brackets">(He relaxes, sits.)</span>
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: That's it - pale sky before dawn, a man standing on his saddle to bang on the shutters - shouts - What's all
the row about?! Clear off! – but then he called our names. You remember that - this man woke us up. <br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Yes.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: We were sent for.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Yes.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: That's why we're here. <span class="actionstyle brackets">(He looks round, seems doubtful, then the explanation.)</span> Travelling.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Yes.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span> <span class="actionstyle brackets">(dramatically)</span>: It was urgent - a matter of extreme urgency, a royal summons, his very words: official
business and no questions asked - lights in the stable-yard; saddle up and off headlong and hotfoot across the land, our guides outstripped in breakneck pursuit of our duty! Fearful lest we come too late.
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(Small pause.)</span>
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Too late for what?
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: How do I know? We haven't got there yet. <br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Then what are we doing here, I ask myself. <br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: You might well ask.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: We better get on.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: You might well think.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Without much conviction; we better get on.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span> <span class="actionstyle brackets">(actively)</span>: Right! <span class="actionstyle brackets">(Pause.)</span> On where?
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Forward.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span> <span class="actionstyle brackets">(forward to footlights)</span>: Ah. <span class="actionstyle brackets">(Hesitates.)</span> Which way do we - <span class="actionstyle brackets">(He turns round.)</span> Which way did we - ? <br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Practically starting from scratch... An awakening, a man standing on his saddle to bang on the shutters,
our names shouted in a certain dawn, a message, a summons... A new record for pitch and toss. We have not been.. picked out... simply to be abandoned... set loose to find our own way... We are entitled to some direction... I would have thought.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span> <span class="actionstyle brackets">(alert, listening)</span>: I say - ! I say -
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(<span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span> rises himself.)</span>
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Yes?
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Like a band. <span class="actionstyle brackets">(He looks around, laughs embarrassedly, expiating himself.)</span> It sounded like - a band.
Drums.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Yes.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span> <span class="actionstyle brackets">(relaxes)</span>: It couldn't have been real.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: "The colours red, blue and green are real. The colour yellow is a mystical experience shared by everybody" - demolish.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span> <span class="actionstyle brackets">(at edge of stage)</span>: It must have been thunder. Like drums...
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(By the end of the next speech, the band is faintly audible.)</span>
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: A man breaking his journey between one place and another at a third place of no name, character,
population or significance, sees a unicorn cross his path and disappear. That in itself is startling, but there
are precedents for mystical encounters of various kinds, or to be less extreme, a choice of persuasions to put it down to fancy; until - "My God," says the second man, "I must be dreaming, I thought I saw a unicorn." At
which point, a dimension is added that makes the experience as alarming as it will ever be. A third witness, you understand, adds no further dimension but only spreads it thinner, and a fourth thinner still, and the more witnesses there are, the thinner it gets and the more reasonable it becomes until it is as thin as reality, the name we give to the common experience... "Look, look" recites the crowd. "A horse with an arrow in its forehead! It
must have been mistaken for a deer."

<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span> <span class="actionstyle brackets">(at the last moment before they enter - wistfully)</span>: I'm sorry it wasn't the unicorn. It would have been nice to
have unicorns.

Perfect! A lucky thing we came along.
<h2 class="myclass"></h2>
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: For us?
<br><br><span class="character PLAYER">PLAYER</span>: Let us hope so. But to meet two gentlemen on the road – we would not hope to meet them off it. <br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: No?
<br><br><span class="character PLAYER">PLAYER</span>: Well met, in fact, and just in time.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Why's that?
<br><br><span class="character PLAYER">PLAYER</span>: Why, we grow rusty and you catch us at the very point of decadence - by this time tomorrow we
might have forgotten everything we ever knew. That's a thought, isn't it? <span class="actionstyle brackets">(He laughs generously.)</span> We'd be back where we started - improvising.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Tumblers, are you?
<br><br><span class="character PLAYER">PLAYER</span>: We can give you a tumble if that's your taste and times being what they are... Otherwise, for a jingle of coin we can do you a selection of gory romances, full of fine cadence and corpses, pirated from Italian;
and it doesn't take much to make a jingle - even a single coin has music in it.
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(They ALL flourish and bow, raggedly.)</span>
Tragedians, at your command.
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(<span class="character ROS">ROS</span> and <span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span> have got to their feet.)</span>
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: My name is Guildenstern, and this is Rosencrantz. <span class="actionstyle brackets">(<span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span> confers briefly with him.)</span>
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(Without embarrassment.)</span> I'm sorry - his name's Guildenstern, and I'm Rosencrantz.
<br><br><span class="character PLAYER">PLAYER</span>: A pleasure. We've played to bigger, of course, but quality counts for something. I recognised you at once -
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: And who are we?
<br><br><span class="character PLAYER">PLAYER</span>: - as fellow artists.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: I thought we were gentlemen.
<br><br><span class="character PLAYER">PLAYER</span>: For some of us it is performance, for others, patronage. They are two sides of the same coin, or, let
us say, being as there are so many of us, the same side of two coins. <span class="actionstyle brackets">(Bows again.)</span> Don't clap too loudly - it's a very old world.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: What is your line?
<br><br><span class="character PLAYER">PLAYER</span>: Tragedy, sir. Deaths and disclosures, universal and particular, denouements both unexpected and inexorable, transvestite melodrama on all levels including the suggestive. We transport you into the world of intrigue and illusion... clowns, if you like, murderers - we can do you ghosts and battles, on the skirmish levels, heroes, villains, tormented lovers - set pieces in the poetic vein; we can do you rapiers or rape or both, by all means, faithless wives and ravished virgins - flagrante delicto at a price, but that comes under realism for which there are special terms. Getting warm, am I?
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span> <span class="actionstyle brackets">(doubtfully)</span>: Well, I don't know...
<br><br><span class="character PLAYER">PLAYER</span>: It costs little to watch, and little more if you happen to get caught up in the action, if that's you taste and times being what they are.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: What are they?
<br><br><span class="character PLAYER">PLAYER</span>: Indifferent.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Bad?

<br><br><span class="character PLAYER">PLAYER</span>: Let your imagination run riot. They are beyond surprise.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: And how much?
<br><br><span class="character PLAYER">PLAYER</span>: To take part?
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: To watch.
<br><br><span class="character PLAYER">PLAYER</span>: Watch what?
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: A private performance.
<br><br><span class="character PLAYER">PLAYER</span>: How private?
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Well, there are only two of us. Is that enough?
<br><br><span class="character PLAYER">PLAYER</span>: For an audience, disappointing. For voyeurs, about average. <br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: What's the difference?
<br><br><span class="character PLAYER">PLAYER</span>: Ten guilders.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span> <span class="actionstyle brackets">(horrified)</span>: Ten guilders!
<br><br><span class="character PLAYER">PLAYER</span>: I mean eight.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Together?
<br><br><span class="character PLAYER">PLAYER</span>: Each. I don't think you understand -
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: What are you saying?
<br><br><span class="character PLAYER">PLAYER</span>: What am I saying - seven.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Where have you been?
<br><br><span class="character PLAYER">PLAYER</span>: Roundabout. A nest of children carries the custom of the town. Juvenile companies, they are the
fashion. But they cannot match our repertoire... we'll stoop to anything if that's your bent... <span class="actionstyle brackets">(He regards <span class="character ROS">ROS</span> meaningfully but <span class="character ROS">ROS</span> returns the stare blankly.)</span>

<span class="actionstyle brackets">(They halt and turn.)</span>
Home, sir.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Where from?
<br><br><span class="character PLAYER">PLAYER</span>: Home. We're travelling people. We take our chances where we find them.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: It was the chance, then?
<br><br><span class="character PLAYER">PLAYER</span>: Chance?
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: You found us.
<br><br><span class="character PLAYER">PLAYER</span>: Oh yes.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: You were looking?
<br><br><span class="character PLAYER">PLAYER</span>: Oh no.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Chance, then.
<br><br><span class="character PLAYER">PLAYER</span>: Or fate.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Yours or ours?
<br><br><span class="character PLAYER">PLAYER</span>: It could hardly be one without the other.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Fate, then.
<br><br><span class="character PLAYER">PLAYER</span>: Oh, yes. We have no control. Tonight we play to the court. Or the night after. Or to the tavern. Or not. <br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Perhaps I can use my influence.
<br><br><span class="character PLAYER">PLAYER</span>: At the tavern?
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: At the court. I would say I have some influence.
<br><br><span class="character PLAYER">PLAYER</span>: Would you say so?
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: I have influence yet.
<br><br><span class="character PLAYER">PLAYER</span>: Yet what?
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(<span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span> seizes the <span class="character PLAYER">PLAYER</span> violently.)</span>

It could have been - a bird out of season, dropping bright-feathered on my shoulder... It could have been a tongueless dwarf

<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: So you give - exhibitions?
<br><br><span class="character PLAYER">PLAYER</span>: Performances, sir.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Yes, of course. There's more money in that, is there? <br><br><span class="character PLAYER">PLAYER</span>: There's more trade, sir.

<br><br><span class="character PLAYER">PLAYER</span>: No.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: I mean, what exactly do you do?
<br><br><span class="character PLAYER">PLAYER</span>: We keep to our usual stuff, more or less, only inside out. We do on stage the things that are
supposed to happen off. Which is a kind of integrity, if you look on every exit being an entrance somewhere else. <br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span> <span class="actionstyle brackets">(nervy, loud)</span>: Well, I'm not really the type of man who - no, but don't hurry off - sit down and tell us about

<br><br><span class="character PLAYER">PLAYER</span>: I start on.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: But it hasn't started. Go on. We'll look out for you.

<span class="actionstyle brackets">(Pause. The <span class="character PLAYER">PLAYER</span> lifts his downstage foot. It was covering <span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>'s coin. <span class="character ROS">ROS</span> puts his foot on the coin. Smiles.)</span>

<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: It was tails.
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(He tosses the coin to <span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span> who catches it. Simultaneously - a lighting change sufficient to alter the exterior

At last, with a little shaking of his arm, and thrice his head waving
up and down, he raises a sigh so piteous and profound that it does seem to shatter all his bulk and end his being. That done he lets her go, and with his head over his shoulder turned, he goes backwards without taking his eyes off her... she runs off in the opposite direction.)</span>

I cannot dream of. I entreat you both

And sith so neighbored to his youth and haviour
That you ... safe your rest here on our court

For the supply and profit of our hope,
Your visitation shall receive such thanks
As fits the king's remembrance.

Might, by the sovereign power you have on us,
Put your dread pleasure more into command

To lay our service freely at your feet,
To be commanded.

happened to you that all of a sudden and for no reason at all you haven't the faintest idea how to spell the word
- "wife" - or "house" - because when you write it down you just can't remember ever having seen those letters in that order before...?
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: I remember...
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Yes?
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: I remember there were no questions.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: There were always questions. To exchange one set for another is no great matter. <br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Answers, yes. There were answers to everything.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: You've forgotten.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span> <span class="actionstyle brackets">(flaring)</span>: I haven't forgotten - how I used to remember my own name - and yours, oh yes! There were answers everywhere you looked. There was no question about it - people knew who I was and if they didn't they asked and I told them.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: You did, the trouble is each of them is... plausible, without being instinctive. All your life you live so close to truth, it becomes a permanent blur in the corner of your eye, and when something nudges it into
outline it is like being ambushed by a grotesque. A man standing in his saddle in the half-lit half-alive dawn banged on the shutters and called two names. He was just a hat and the cloak levitating in the grey plume of his own breath, but when he called we came. That much is certain - we came. <br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Well I can tell you I'm sick to death of it. I don't care one way or another, so why don't you make up your mind.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: We can't afford anything quite so arbitrary. Nor did we come all this way for a christening. All that - preceded us. But we are comparatively fortunate; we might have been left to sift the whole field of human nomenclature, like two blind men looting a bazaar for their own portraits... At least we are presented with alternatives.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Well as from now -
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: - But not choice.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: You made me look ridiculous in there.

<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: We don't owe anything to anyone.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: We've been caught up. Your smallest action sets off another somewhere else, and is set off by it. Keep
an eye open, an ear cocked. Tread warily, follow instructions. We'll be all right.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: For how long?
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Till events have played themselves out. There's a logic at work - it's all done for you, don't worry. Enjoy it.
Relax. To be taken in hand and led, like being a child again, even without the innocence, a child - It's
like being given a prize, an extra slice of childhood when you least expect it, as a prize for being good, or a compensation for never having had one... Do I contradict myself?
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: I don't remember. What have we got to go on?
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: We have been briefed. Hamlet's transformation. What do you recollect?
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Well, he's changed, hasn't he? The exterior and inward man fails to resemble -
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Draw him on to pleasures - glean what afflicts him.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Something more than his father's death -
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: He's always talking about us - there aren't two people living whom he dotes on more than us. <br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: We cheer him up - find out what's the matter -
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Exactly, it's the matter of asking the right questions and giving away as little as we can. It's a game. <br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: And then we can go?
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: And receive such thanks as fits a king's remembrance.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: I like the sound of that. What do you think he means by remembrance?
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: He doesn't forget his friends.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Wouldn't you care to estimate?
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Difficult to say, really - come kings tend to be amnesiac, others I suppose - the opposite, whatever that is... <br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Yes - but -
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Elephantine...?
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Hot how long - how much?
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Retentive - he's a very retentive king, a royal retainer...
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: What are you playing at?
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Words, words. They're all we have to go on.
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(Pause.)</span>
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Shouldn't we be doing something - constructive?
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: What did you have in mind?... A short, blunt human pyramid...?
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: We could go.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Where?
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: After him.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Why? They've got us placed now - if we start moving around, we'll all be chasing each other all night. <span class="actionstyle brackets">(Hiatus.)</span>

<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: No. <span class="actionstyle brackets">(At footlights.)</span> What a fine persecution - to be kept intrigued without ever quite being

<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: I'm him, you see.
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(Beat.)</span>
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Who am I then?
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: You're yourself.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: And he's you?
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Not a bit of it.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Are you afflicted?
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: That's the idea. Are you ready?
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Let's go back a bit.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: I'm afflicted.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: I see.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Glean what afflicts me.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Right.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Question and answer.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: How should I begin?
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Address me.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: My dear Guildenstern!
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span> <span class="actionstyle brackets">(quietly)</span>: You've forgotten - haven't you?
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: My dear Rosencrantz!
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span> <span class="actionstyle brackets">(great control)</span>: I don't think you quite understand. What we are attempting is a hypothesis in which I
answer for him, while you ask me questions. <br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Ah! Ready?
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: You know what to do?
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: What?
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Are you stupid?
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Pardon?
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Are you deaf?
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Did you speak?
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span> <span class="actionstyle brackets">(admonishing)</span>: Not now - <span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Statement.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span> <span class="actionstyle brackets">(shouts)</span>: Not now! <span class="actionstyle brackets">(Pause.)</span> If I had my doubts, or rather hopes, they are dispelled. What could we possibly have in common except our situation? <span class="actionstyle brackets">(They separate and sit.)</span> Perhaps he'll come back this way.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Should we go?
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Why?
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(Pause.)</span>
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span> <span class="actionstyle brackets">(starts up. Snaps fingers.)</span>: Oh! You mean - you pretend to be him, and I ask you questions! <br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span> <span class="actionstyle brackets">(dry)</span>: Very good.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: You had me confused. <br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: I could see I had. <br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: How should I begin? <br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Address me.
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(They stand and face each other, posing.)</span> <br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: My honoured Lord!
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: My dear Rosencrantz!
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(Pause.)</span>
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Am I pretending to be you, then?
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Certainly not. If you like. Shall we continue? <br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Question and answer.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Right.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Right. My honoured Lord!
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: My dear fellow!
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: How are you?
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Afflicted!
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Really? In what way?
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Transformed.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Inside or out?
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Both.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: I see. <span class="actionstyle brackets">(Pause.)</span> No much new there.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Go into details. Delve. Probe the background, establish the situation.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: So - so your uncle is the king of Denmark?
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: And my father before him.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: But surely -
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: You might well ask.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Let me get it straight. Your father was king. You were his only son. Your father dies. You are of age. Your
uncle becomes king. <br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Yes.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Unorthodox.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Undid me.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Undeniable. Where were you?
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: In Germany.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Usurpation, then.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: He slipped in.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Which reminds me.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Well, it would.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: I don't want to be personal.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: It's common knowledge.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Your mother's marriage.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: He slipped in.
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(Beat.)</span>
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span> <span class="actionstyle brackets">(lugubriously)</span>: His body was still warm. <br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: So was hers.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Extraordinary.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Indecent.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Hasty.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Suspicious.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: It makes you think.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Don't think I haven't though of it. <br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: And with her husband's brother. <br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: They were close.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: She went to him -
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: - Too close -
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: - for comfort.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: It looks bad.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: It adds up.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Incest and adultery.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Would you go so far?
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Never.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: To sum up: your father, whom you love, dies, you are his heir, you come back to find that hardly was the
corpse cold before his young brother popped on to his throne and into his sheets, thereby offending both legal and natural practice. Now, why exactly you behaving in this extraordinary manner?
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: I can't imagine. <span class="actionstyle brackets">(Pause.)</span> But all that is well known, common property. Yet he sent for us. And we did come.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span> <span class="actionstyle brackets">(alert, ear cocked)</span>: I say! I heard music - <span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: We're here.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: - Like a band - I thought I heard a band. <br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Rosencrantz...
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span> <span class="actionstyle brackets">(absently, still listening)</span>: What? <span class="actionstyle brackets">(Pause, short.)</span>
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span> <span class="actionstyle brackets">(gently wry)</span>: Guildenstern... <br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span> <span class="actionstyle brackets">(irritated by the repetition)</span>: What? <br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Don't you discriminate at all? <br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span> <span class="actionstyle brackets">(turning dumbly)</span>: What?
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(Pause.)</span>
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Go and see if he's there.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Who?
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: There.
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(<span class="character ROS">ROS</span> goes to an upstage wing, looks, returns, formally making his report.)</span>
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Yes.

<span class="actionstyle brackets">(<span class="character ROS">ROS</span> repeats movement.)</span>
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Talking.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: To himself?
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(<span class="character ROS">ROS</span> starts to move. <span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span> cuts him impatiently.)</span>
Is he alone?
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: No.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Then he's not talking to himself, is he?
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Not by himself... Coming this way, I think. <span class="actionstyle brackets">(Shiftily.)</span> Should we go?
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Why? We're marked now.

<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>: ... for you yourself, sir, should be as old as I am if like a crab you could go backwards. <br><br><span class="character POLONIUS">POLONIUS</span> <span class="actionstyle brackets">(aside)</span>: Though this be madness, yet there is method in it.
Will you walk out of air, my Lord?
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>: Into my grave.

The first illegible line is <span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>'s, coming at the end of a short speech ? see Shakespeare Act II, scene ii.

<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: What?

<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: No.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Ah.
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(Pause.)</span>
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: I think we can say we made some headway.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: You think so?
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: I think we can say that.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: I think we can say he made us look ridiculous.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: We played it close to the chest of course.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span> <span class="actionstyle brackets">(derisively)</span>: "Question and answer. Old ways are the best ways"! He was scoring off us all down the line. <br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: He caught us on the wrong foot once or twice, perhaps, but I thought we gained some ground.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span> <span class="actionstyle brackets">(simply)</span>: He murdered us.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: He might have had the edge.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span> <span class="actionstyle brackets">(roused)</span>: Twenty-seven - three, and you think he might have had the edge?! He murdered us.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: What about our evasions?
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Oh, our evasions were lovely. "Were you sent for?" he says. "My lord, we were sent for..." I didn't where
to put myself.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: He had six rhetoricals -
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: It was question and answer, all right. Twenty-seven questions he got out in ten minutes, and answered
three. I was waiting for you to delve. "When is he going to start delving?" I asked myself. <br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: - And two repetitions.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Hardly a leading question between us.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: We got his symptoms, didn't we?
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Half of what he said meant something else, and the other half
didn't mean anything at all.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Thwarted ambition - a sense of grievance, that's my diagnosis.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Six rhetorical and two repetitions, leaving nineteen of which we answered fifteen. And what did we get
in return? He's depressed!... Denmark's a prison and he'd rather live in a nutshell; some shadow-play
about the nature of ambition, which never got down to cases, and finally one direct question which might have led somewhere, and led in fact to his illuminating claim to tell a hawk from a handsaw.
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(Pause.)</span>
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: When the wind is southerly.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: And when the weather is clear.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: And when it isn't he can't.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: He's at the mercy of the elements. <span class="actionstyle brackets">(Licks his finger and holds it up - facing audience.)</span> Is that southerly? <span class="actionstyle brackets">(They stare at the audience.)</span>
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: It doesn't look southerly. What made you think so?
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: I didn't say I think so. It could be northerly for all I know.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: I wouldn't have thought so.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Well, if you're going to be dogmatic.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Wait a minute - we came from roughly south according to a rough map.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: I see. Well, which way did we come in? <span class="actionstyle brackets">(<span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span> looks around vaguely.)</span> Roughly.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span> <span class="actionstyle brackets">(clears his throat)</span>: In the morning the sun would be easterly. I think we can assume that.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: That it's morning?
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: If it is, and the sun is over there <span class="actionstyle brackets">(his right as he faces the audience)</span> for instance, that <span class="actionstyle brackets">(front)</span> would be
northerly. On the other hand, if it's not morning and the sun is over there <span class="actionstyle brackets">(his left)</span>... that... <span class="actionstyle brackets">(lamely)</span> would still be northerly. <span class="actionstyle brackets">(Picking up.)</span> To put it another way, if we came from down there <span class="actionstyle brackets">(front)</span> and it is morning, the sun would be up there <span class="actionstyle brackets">(his left)</span>, and if it is actually over there <span class="actionstyle brackets">(his right)</span> and it's still morning, we must have come from up there <span class="actionstyle brackets">(behind him)</span>, and if that is southerly <span class="actionstyle brackets">(his left)</span> and the sun is really over there <span class="actionstyle brackets">(front)</span>, then it's afternoon. However, if none of these is the case –
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Why don't you go and have a look?
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Pragmatism?! - is that all you have to offer? You seem to have no conception of where we stand! You won't find the answer written down for you in the bowl of a compass - I can tell you that. <span class="actionstyle brackets">(Pause.)</span> Besides, you can never tell this far north - it's probably dark out there.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: I merely suggest that the position of the sun, if it is out, would give you a rough idea of the time; alternatively, the clock, if it is going, would give you a rough idea of the position of the sun. I forget which you're trying to establish.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: I'm trying to establish the direction of the wind.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: There isn't any wind. Draught, yes.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: In that case, the origin. Trace it to the source and it might give us a rough idea of the way we came in -
which might give us a rough idea of south, for further reference.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: It's coming up through the floor. <span class="actionstyle brackets">(He studies the floor.)</span> That can't be south, can it? <br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: That's not direction. Lick your toe and wave it around a bit.
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(<span class="character ROS">ROS</span> considers the distance to his foot.)</span>
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: No, I think you'd have to lick it for me. <span class="actionstyle brackets">(Pause.)</span>
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: I'm prepared to let the whole matter drop. <br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Or I could lick yours, of course.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: No thank you.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: I'll even wave it around for you.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span> <span class="actionstyle brackets">(down <span class="character ROS">ROS</span>'s throat)</span>: What in God's name is the matter with you?
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Just being friendly.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span> <span class="actionstyle brackets">(retiring)</span>: Somebody might come in. It's what we're counting on, after all. Ultimately.
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(Good pause.)</span>
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Perhaps they've all trampled each other to death in the rush. Give them a shout. Something provocative.
Intrigue them.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Wheels have been set in motion, and they have their own pace, to which we are... condemned. Each
move is dictated by the previous one - that is the meaning of order. If we start being arbitrary it'll just be a shambles: at least, let us hope so. Because if we happened, just happened to discover, or even suspect, that our spontaneity was part of their order, we'd know that we were lost. <span class="actionstyle brackets">(He sits.)</span> A Chinaman of the T'ang Dynasty - and, by which definition, a philosopher - dreamed he was a butterfly, and from that moment he was never quite sure that he was not a butterfly dreaming it was a Chinese philosopher. Envy him, in his two-fold security.
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(A good pause. <span class="character ROS">ROS</span> leaps up and bellows at the audience.)</span> <br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Fire!
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(<span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span> jumps up.)</span>
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Where?
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: It's all right - I'm demonstrating the misuse of free speech. To prove that it exists. <span class="actionstyle brackets">(He regards the audience, that is the direction, with contempt - and other directions, then front again.)</span> Not a move. They should burn to death in their shoes.
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(<span class="character ROS">ROS</span> takes out one of his coins. Spins it. Catches it. Looks at it. Replaces it.)</span>
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: What was it?
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: What?
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Heads or tails?
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Oh. I didn't look.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Yes you did.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Oh, did I? <span class="actionstyle brackets">(He takes a coin, studies it.)</span> Quite right - it rings a bell. <br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: What's the last thing you remember?
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: I don't wish to be reminded of it.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: We cross our bridges when we come to them and burn them behind us, with nothing to show our progress except a memory of the smell of smoke, and a presumption that once our eyes watered.
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(<span class="character ROS">ROS</span> approaches him brightly, holding a coin between finger and thumb.
He covers it with the other hand, draws his fist apart and holds them for <span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>. <span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span> considers them. Indicates the left hand, <span class="character ROS">ROS</span> opens it to show it empty.)</span>
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: No.
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(Repeat process. <span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span> indicates left hand again. <br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span> shows it empty.)</span>
Double bluff!
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(Repeat process - <span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span> taps one hand, then the other hand, quickly. <span class="character ROS">ROS</span> inadvertently shows that both are
empty. <span class="character ROS">ROS</span> laughs as <span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span> turns upstage. <span class="character ROS">ROS</span> stops laughing, looks around his left, pats his clothes, puzzled.)</span> <span class="actionstyle brackets">(<span class="character POLONIUS">POLONIUS</span> breaks that up by entering upstage followed by the <span class="character TRAGEDIANS">TRAGEDIANS</span>

<br><br><span class="character POLONIUS">POLONIUS</span> <span class="actionstyle brackets">(entering)</span>: Come, sirs.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>: Follow him, friends. We'll hear a play tomorrow.
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(Aside to the <span class="character PLAYER">PLAYER</span>, who is the last of the <span class="character TRAGEDIANS">TRAGEDIANS</span>.)</span>
Dost thou hear me, old friend? Can you play "The Murder of Gonzago"?
<br><br><span class="character PLAYER">PLAYER</span>: Ay, my lord.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>: We'll ha't tomorrow night. You could for a need study a speech of some dozen or sixteen lines which I
would set down and insert in't, could you not?
<br><br><span class="character PLAYER">PLAYER</span>: Ay, my lord.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>: Very well. Follow that lord, and look you mock him not.
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(The <span class="character PLAYER">PLAYER</span> crossing downstage, notes <span class="character ROS">ROS</span> and <span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>. Stops. <span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span> crossing downstage addresses
them without a pause.)</span>
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>: My good friends, I'll leave you till tonight. You are welcome to Elsinore.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Good, my lord.
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(<span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span> goes.)</span>
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: So you've caught up.
<br><br><span class="character PLAYER">PLAYER</span> <span class="actionstyle brackets">(coldly)</span>: Not yet, sir.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Now mind your tongue, or we'll have it out and throw the rest of you away, like a nightingale at a Roman
feast.
<br><br><span class="character PLAYER">PLAYER</span>: Took the very words out of my mouth. <br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: You'd be lost for words.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: You'd be tongue-tied.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Like a mute in a monologue.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Like a nightingale at a Roman feast. <br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Your diction will go to pieces.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Your lines will be cut.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: To dumbshows.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: And dramatic pauses.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: You'll never find your tongue.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Lick your lips.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Taste your tears.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Your breakfast.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: You won't know the difference.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: There won't be any.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: We'll take the very words out of your mouth.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: So you've caught up.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: So you've caught up.
<br><br><span class="character PLAYER">PLAYER</span> <span class="actionstyle brackets">(tops)</span>: Not yet! <span class="actionstyle brackets">(Bitterly.)</span> You left us.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Ah! I'd forgotten - you performed a dramatic spectacle by the wayside - a thing much thought of in the
New Testament. How did yours compare as an impromptu?
<br><br><span class="character PLAYER">PLAYER</span>: Badly - neither witnessed nor reported.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Yes, I'm sorry we had to miss it. I hope you didn't leave anything out - I'd be furious to think I didn't
miss all of it.
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(The <span class="character PLAYER">PLAYER</span>, progressively aggrieved, now burst out.)</span>
<br><br><span class="character PLAYER">PLAYER</span>: We can't look each other in the face! <span class="actionstyle brackets">(Pause, more in control.)</span> You don't understand the humiliation of
it - to be tricked out of a single assumption, which makes our existence viable - that somebody is watching...
The plot was two corpses gone before we caught sight of ourselves, stripped naked in the middle of nowhere and pouring ourselves down a bottomless well.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Is that thirty eight?
<br><br><span class="character PLAYER">PLAYER</span> <span class="actionstyle brackets">(lost)</span>: There we are - demented children mincing about in clothes that no one ever wore, speaking as no man ever spoke, swearing love in wigs and rhymed couplets, killing each other with wooden swords, hollow protestations of faith hurled after empty promises of vengeance - and every gesture, every pose, vanishing into the thin unpopulated air. We ransomed our dignity to the clouds, and the uncomprehending birds listened. <span class="actionstyle brackets">(He rounds on them.)</span> Don't you see?! We're actors - we're the opposite of people! <span class="actionstyle brackets">(They recoil nonplussed, his voice calms.)</span> Think, in your head, now, think of the most... private... secret... intimate... thing you have ever
done secure in the knowledge of its privacy... <span class="actionstyle brackets">(He gives them - and the audience - a good pause. <span class="character ROS">ROS</span> takes a shifty look.)</span> Are you thinking of it? <span class="actionstyle brackets">(He strikes with his voice and his head.)</span> Well, I saw you do it!
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(<span class="character ROS">ROS</span> leaps up, dissembling madly.)</span>
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: You never! It's a lie! <span class="actionstyle brackets">(He catches himself with a giggle in a vacuum and sits down again.)</span>
<br><br><span class="character PLAYER">PLAYER</span>: We're actors... We pledged our identities, secure in the conventions of our trade; that someone
would be watching. And than, gradually, no one was. We were caught, high and dry. It was not until the murder's long soliloquy that we were able to look around; frozen we were in the profil, our eyes searched you out, first confidently, then hesitantly, then desperately as each patch of turf, each log, each exposed corned in
every direction proved uninhabited, and all the while the murderous King addressed the horizon with his dreary interminable guilt... Our heads began to move, wary as lizards, the corpse of unsullied Rosalinda peeped through his fingers, and the King faltered. Even then, habit and a stubborn trust that our audience spied upon us from behind the nearest bush, forced our bodies to blunder on long after they had emptied of meaning, until like runaway carts they dragged to a halt. No one came forward. No one shouted at us. The silence was unbreakable, it imposed itself upon us; it was obscene.
We took off our crowns and swords and cloth of gold and moved silent on the road to Elsinore.
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(Silence. Then <span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span> claps solo with slow measured irony.)</span>
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Brilliantly re-created - if these eyes could weep!... Rather strong on metaphor, mind you. No criticism -
only a matter of taste. And so here you are - with a vengeance. That's a figure of speech... isn't it? Well let's say we've made up for it, for you may have no doubt whom to thank for your performance at the court.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: We are counting on you to take him out of himself. You are the pleasures which we draw him on to - <span class="actionstyle brackets">(he escapes a fractional giggle but recovers immediately)</span> and by that I don't mean your usual filth; you can't .
treat royalty like people with normal perverted desires. They know nothing of that and you know nothing of them, to your mutual survival. So give him a good clean show suitable for all the family, or you can rest assured you'll
be playing the tavern tonight.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Or the night, after.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Or not.
<br><br><span class="character PLAYER">PLAYER</span>: We already have an entry here. And always have had. <br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: You've played for him before?
<br><br><span class="character PLAYER">PLAYER</span>: Yes, sir.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: And what's his bent?
<br><br><span class="character PLAYER">PLAYER</span>: Classical.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Saucy!
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: What will you play?
<br><br><span class="character PLAYER">PLAYER</span>: "The Murder of Gonzago".
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Full of fine cadence and corpses.
<br><br><span class="character PLAYER">PLAYER</span>: Pirated from the Italian....
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: What is it about?
<br><br><span class="character PLAYER">PLAYER</span>: It's about a King and Queen....
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Escapism! What else?
<br><br><span class="character PLAYER">PLAYER</span>: Blood - -
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: - Love and rhetoric.
<br><br><span class="character PLAYER">PLAYER</span>: Yes. <span class="actionstyle brackets">(Going.)</span>
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Where are you going?
<br><br><span class="character PLAYER">PLAYER</span>: I can come and go as I please.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: You're evidently a man who knows his way around.
<br><br><span class="character PLAYER">PLAYER</span>: I've been here before.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: We're still finding our feet.
<br><br><span class="character PLAYER">PLAYER</span>: I should concentrate on not losing your heads.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Do you speak from knowledge?
<br><br><span class="character PLAYER">PLAYER</span>: Precedent.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: You've been here before.
<br><br><span class="character PLAYER">PLAYER</span>: And I know which way the wind is blowing.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Operating on two levels, are we?! How clever! I expect it comes
naturally to you, being in the business so to speak.
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(The <span class="character PLAYER">PLAYER</span>'s grave face does not change. He makes to move off again.
<span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span> for the second time cuts him off.)</span>
The truth is, we value your company, for want of any other. We have been left so much to our own devices -
after a while one welcomes the uncertainty of being left to other people's. <br><br><span class="character PLAYER">PLAYER</span>: Uncertainty is the normal state. You're nobody special.
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(He makes to leave again. <span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span> loses his cool.)</span>
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: But for God's sake what are we supposed to do?
<br><br><span class="character PLAYER">PLAYER</span>: Relax. Respond. That's what people do. You can't go through life questioning your situation at every turn.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: But we don't know what's going on, or what to do with ourselves. We don't know how to act.
<br><br><span class="character PLAYER">PLAYER</span>: Act natural. You know why you're here at least.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: We only know what we're told, and that's little enough. And for all we know it isn't even true.
<br><br><span class="character PLAYER">PLAYER</span>: For all anyone knows, nothing is. Everything has to be taken on trust; truth is only that which is taken
to be true. It's the currency of living. There may be nothing behind it, but it doesn't make any difference so long as it is honoured. One acts on assumptions. What do you assume?
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Hamlet is not himself, outside or in. We have to glean what afflicts him.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: He doesn't give much away. <br><br><span class="character PLAYER">PLAYER</span>: Who does, nowadays? <br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: He's - melancholy. <br><br><span class="character PLAYER">PLAYER</span>: Melancholy?
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Mad.
<br><br><span class="character PLAYER">PLAYER</span>: How is he mad?
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Ah. <span class="actionstyle brackets">(To <span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>.)</span> How is he mad?
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: More morose than mad, perhaps.
<br><br><span class="character PLAYER">PLAYER</span>: Melancholy.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Moody.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: He has moods.
<br><br><span class="character PLAYER">PLAYER</span>: Of moroseness?
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Madness. And yet.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Quite.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: For instance.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: He talks to himself, which might be madness.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: If he didn't talk sense, which he does.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Which suggests the opposite.
<br><br><span class="character PLAYER">PLAYER</span>: Of what?
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(Small pause.)</span>
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: I think I have it. A man talking sense to himself is no madder
than a man talking nonsense not to himself. <br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Or just as mad.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Or just as mad.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: And he does both.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: So there you are. <br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Stark raving sane. <span class="actionstyle brackets">(Pause.)</span>
<br><br><span class="character PLAYER">PLAYER</span>: Why?
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Ah. <span class="actionstyle brackets">(To <span class="character ROS">ROS</span>.)</span> Why? <br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Exactly.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Exactly what? . <br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Exactly why.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Exactly why what? <br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: What?
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Why?
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Why what, exactly? <br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Why is he mad?! <br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: I don't know! <span class="actionstyle brackets">(Beat.)</span>
<br><br><span class="character PLAYER">PLAYER</span>: The old man thinks he's in love with his daughter.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span> <span class="actionstyle brackets">(appalled)</span>: Good God! We're out of our depth here.
<br><br><span class="character PLAYER">PLAYER</span>: No, no, no - he hasn't got a daughter - the old man thinks he's in love with his daughter.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: The old man is?
<br><br><span class="character PLAYER">PLAYER</span>: Hamlet, in love with the old man's daughter, the old man thinks.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Ha! It's beginning to make sense! Unrequited passion!
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(The <span class="character PLAYER">PLAYER</span> moves.)</span>
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span> <span class="actionstyle brackets">(Fascist)</span>: Nobody leaves this room! <span class="actionstyle brackets">(Pause, lamely.)</span> Without a very good reason.
<br><br><span class="character PLAYER">PLAYER</span>: Why not?
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: All this strolling about is getting too arbitrary by half - I'm rapidly losing my grip. From now on reason will
prevail.
<br><br><span class="character PLAYER">PLAYER</span>: I have lines to learn.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Pass!
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(The <span class="character PLAYER">PLAYER</span> passes into one of the wings. <span class="character ROS">ROS</span> cups his hands and shouts into the opposite one.)</span> <br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Next!
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(But no one comes.)</span>
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: What did you expect?
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Something ... someone ... nothing. <span class="actionstyle brackets">(They sit facing front.)</span>
Are you hungry?
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: No, are you?
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span> <span class="actionstyle brackets">(thinks)</span>: No. You remember that coin? <br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: No.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: I think I lost it.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: What coin?
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: I don't remember exactly.
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(Pause.)</span>
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Oh, that coin ... clever.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: I can't remember how I did it. <br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: It probably comes natural to you. <br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Yes, I've got a show-stopper there. <br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Do it again.
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(Slight pause.)</span>
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: We can't afford it.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Yes, one must think of the future.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: It's the normal thing.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: To have one. One is, after all, having it all the time... now...
and now... and now....
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: It could go on for ever. Well, not for ever, I suppose. <span class="actionstyle brackets">(Pause.)</span> Do you ever think of yourself as actually
dead, lying in a box with a lid on it? <br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: No.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Nor do I, really.... It's silly to be depressed by it. I mean one thinks of it like being alive in a box, one keeps forgetting to take into account the fact that one is dead ... which should make a difference ...
shouldn't it? I mean, you'd never know you were in a box, would you? It would be just like being asleep in a box. Not that I'd like to sleep in a box, mind you, not without any air - you'd wake up dead, for a start and
then where would you be? Apart from inside a box. That's the bit I don't like, frankly. That's why I don't think of it.... <span class="actionstyle brackets">(<span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span> stirs restlessly, pulling his cloak round him.)</span>
Because you'd be helpless, wouldn't you? Stuffed in a box like that, I mean you'd be in there for ever. Even
taking into account the fact that you're dead, really ... ask yourself, if I asked you straight off - I'm
going to stuff you in this box now, would you rather be alive or dead? Naturally, you'd prefer to be alive. Life in a box is better than no life at all. I expect. You'd have a chance at least. You could lie there thinking -
well, at least I'm not dead! In a minute someone's going to bang on the lid and tell me to come out. <span class="actionstyle brackets">(Banging on the floor with his fists.)</span> "Hey you, whatsyername! Come out of there!"
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span> <span class="actionstyle brackets">(jumps up savagely)</span>: You don't have to flog it to death!
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(Pause.)</span>
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: I wouldn't think about it, if I were you. You'd only get depressed. <span class="actionstyle brackets">(Pause.)</span> Eternity is a terrible
thought. I mean, where's it going to end? <span class="actionstyle brackets">(Pause, then brightly.)</span> Two early Christians chanced to meet in Heaven. "Saul of Tarsus yet!" cried one. "What are you doing here?!" ... "Tarsus-Schmarsus", replied the other, "I'm Paul already."
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(<span class="character ROS">ROS</span> stands up restlessly and flaps his arms.)</span>
They don't care. We count for nothing. We could remain silent till we're green in the face, they wouldn't come. <br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Blue, red.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: A Christian, a Moslem and a Jew chanced to meet in a closed carriage.... "Silverstein!" cried the Jew,
"Who's your friend?" ... "His name's Abdullah", replied the Moslem, "but he's no friend of mine since he
became a convert." <span class="actionstyle brackets">(He leaps up again, stamps his foot and shouts into the wings.)</span> All right, we know you're in there! Come out talking! <span class="actionstyle brackets">(Pause.)</span> We have no control. None at all.... <span class="actionstyle brackets">(He paces.)</span> Whatever became of the moment when one first knew about death? There must have been one, a moment, in childhood when it first occurred to you that you don't go on for ever. It must have been shattering - stamped into one's memory. And yet I can't remember it. It never occurred to me at all. What does one make of that? We must be born with an intuition of mortality. Before we know the words for it, before we know that there are words, out we come, bloodied and squalling with the knowledge that for all the compasses in the world, there's only one direction, and time is its only measure. <span class="actionstyle brackets">(He reflects, getting more desperate and rapid.)</span> A Hindu, a Buddhist and a lion-tamer chanced to meet, in a circus on the Indo-Chinese border. <span class="actionstyle brackets">(He breaks out.)</span> They're taking us for granted! Well, I won't stand for it! In future, notice will be taken. <span class="actionstyle brackets">(He wheels again to face into the wings.)</span> Keep out, then! I forbid anyone to
enter! <span class="actionstyle brackets">(No one comes - Breathing heavily.)</span> That's better....
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(Immediately, behind him a grand procession enters, principally

<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Madam, it so fell out that certain players
We o'erraught on the way: of these we told him
And there did seem in him a kind of joy
To hear of it. They are here about the court, And, as I think, they have already order
This night to play before him.

<span class="actionstyle brackets">(<span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span> meanwhile has approached the other <span class="character SPIES">SPY</span>, brow creased in thought.)</span>
<br><br><span class="character PLAYER">PLAYER</span> <span class="actionstyle brackets">(to <span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>)</span>: Are you familiar with this play?
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: No.
<br><br><span class="character PLAYER">PLAYER</span>: A slaughterhouse-eight corpses all told. It brings out the best in us.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span> <span class="actionstyle brackets">(tense, progressively rattled during the whole mime and commentary)</span>: You!-What do you know about
death?
<br><br><span class="character PLAYER">PLAYER</span>: It's what the actors do best. They have to exploit whatever talent is given to them, and their talent is
dying. They can die heroically, comically, ironically, slowly, suddenly, disgustingly, charmingly, or from a great height. My own talent is more general. I extract significance from melodrama, a significance which it does not in fact contain; but occasionally, from out of this matter, there escapes a thin beam of light that, seen at the right angle, can crack the shell of mortality.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Is that all they can do-die?
<br><br><span class="character PLAYER">PLAYER</span>: No, no-they kill beautifully. In fact some of them kill even better than they die. The rest die better than they kill. They're a team.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Which ones are which?
<br><br><span class="character PLAYER">PLAYER</span>: There's not much in it.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span> <span class="actionstyle brackets">(fear, derision)</span>: Actors! The mechanics of cheap melodrama! That isn't death! <span class="actionstyle brackets">(More quietly.)</span> You scream
and choke and sink to your knees, but it doesn't bring death home to anyone-it doesn't catch them unawares and start the whisper in their skulls that says-"One day you are going to die." <span class="actionstyle brackets">(He straightens up.)</span> You die so many times; how can you expect them to believe in your death?
<br><br><span class="character PLAYER">PLAYER</span>: On the contrary, it's the only kind they do believe. They're conditioned to it. I had an actor once who was condemned to hang for stealing a sheep-or a lamb, I forget which-so I got permission to have him hanged in the middle of a play-had to change the plot a bit but I thought it would be effective, you know-and you wouldn't believe it, he just wasn't convincing! It was impossible to suspend one's, disbelief-and what with the audience jeering and throwing peanuts, the whole thing was a disaster!-he did nothing but cry all the time-right out of character-just stood there and cried... Never again.
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(In good humour he has already turned back to the mime: the two <span class="character SPIES">SPIES</span> awaiting execution at the hands of the <span class="character PLAYER">PLAYER</span>.)</span> Audiences know what to expect, and that is all that they are prepared to believe in. <span class="actionstyle brackets">(To the <span class="character SPIES">SPIES</span>.)</span>

speaks.)</span>
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: No, no, no... you've got it all wrong... you can't act death. The fact of it is nothing to do with seeing it
happen - it's not gasps and blood and falling about - that isn't what makes it death. It's just a man failing
to reappear, that's all - now you see him, now you don't that's the only thing that's real: here one minute and gone the next and never coming back - an exit, unobtrusive and unannounced, a disappearance gathering weight as it goes on, until, finally, it is heavy with death.
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(The two <span class="character SPIES">SPIES</span> lie still, barely visible.

<span class="actionstyle brackets">(<span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span> enters opposite, slowly, dragging <span class="character POLONIUS">POLONIUS's BODY</span>. He enters upstage, makes a small arc and leaves by the same side, a few feet downstage.)</span>

<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: There's a limit to what two people can do.

<span class="actionstyle brackets">(Pause.)</span>

<span class="actionstyle brackets">(<span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span> enters. <span class="character ROS">ROS</span> is a little dismayed.)</span>
What have you done, my lord, with the dead body?
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>: Compounded it with dust, whereto 'tis kin.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Tell us where 'tis, that we may take it thence and bear it to the chapel. <br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>: Do not believe it.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Believe what?
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>: That I can keep your counsel and not mine own. Besides, to be demanded of a sponge, what replication should be made by the son of a king?
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Take you me for a sponge, my lord?
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>: Ay, sir, that soaks up the king's countenance, his rewards, his authorities. But such officers do the King best service in the end. He keeps them, like an ape, in the corner of his jaw, first mouthed, to be last
swallowed. When he needs what you have gleaned, it is but squeezing you and, sponge, you shall be dry again.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: I understand you not, my lord.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>: I am glad of it: a knavish speech sleeps in a foolish ear.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: My lord, you must tell us where the body is and go with us to the King.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>: The body is with the King, but the King is not with the body. The King is a thing-
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: A thing, my lord -?
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>: Of nothing. Bring me to him.
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(<span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span> moves resolutely towards one wing. They move with him, shepherding. Just before they reach
the exit, <span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>, apparently seeing <span class="character CLAUDIUS">CLAUDIUS</span> approaching from off stage, bends low in a sweeping bow. <span class="character ROS">ROS</span> and <span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>, cued by <span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>, also bow deeply-a sweeping ceremonial bow with their cloaks swept round them. <span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>, however, continues the movement into an about-turn and walks off in the opposite direction. <span class="character ROS">ROS</span> and <span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>, with their heads low, do not notice. No one comes on. <span class="character ROS">ROS</span> and <span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span> squint upwards and
find that they are bowing to nothing.
<span class="character CLAUDIUS">CLAUDIUS</span> enters behind them. At his first words they leap up and do a double-take.)</span>
<br><br><span class="character CLAUDIUS">CLAUDIUS</span>: How now? What hath befallen?
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Where the body is bestowed, my lord, we cannot get from him.
<br><br><span class="character CLAUDIUS">CLAUDIUS</span>: But where is he?
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span> <span class="actionstyle brackets">(fractional hesitation)</span>: Without, my lord; guarded to know your pleasure.
<br><br><span class="character CLAUDIUS">CLAUDIUS</span> <span class="actionstyle brackets">(moves)</span>: Bring him before us.
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(This hits <span class="character ROS">ROS</span> between the eyes but only his eyes show it. Again his hesitation is fractional. And then with
great deliberation he turns to <span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>.)</span>

<span class="actionstyle brackets">(Again there is a fractional moment in which <span class="character ROS">ROS</span> is smug, CUIL is trapped and betrayed. <br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span> opens his

that be ail? And why us?-anybody would have done. And we have contributed nothing. <br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: It was a trying episode while it lasted, but they've done with us now.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Done what?
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: I don't pretend to have understood. Frankly, I'm not very interested. If they won't tell us, that's their affair. <span class="actionstyle brackets">(He wanders upstage towards the exit.)</span> For my part, I'm only glad that that's the last we've seen of him- <span class="actionstyle brackets">(And he glances offstage and turns front, his face betraying the fact that <span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span> is there.)</span>

Is he alone?
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: No, he's with a soldier,
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Then he's not talking to himself, is he?
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Not by himself... Should we go?
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Where?
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Anywhere.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Why?
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(<span class="character ROS">ROS</span> puts up his head listening.)</span>
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: There it is again. <span class="actionstyle brackets">(In anguish.)</span> All I ask is a change of ground!
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span> <span class="actionstyle brackets">(coda)</span>: Give us this day our daily round...
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(<span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span> enters behind them, talking with a soldier in arms. <span class="character ROS">ROS</span> and <span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span> don't look round.)</span>
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: They'll have us hanging about till we're dead. At least. And the weather will change. <span class="actionstyle brackets">(Looks up.)</span> The
spring can't last for ever.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>: Good sir, whose powers are these?
<br><br><span class="character ESCORT">SOLDIER</span>: They are of Norway, sir.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>: How purposed, sir, I pray you?
<br><br><span class="character ESCORT">SOLDIER</span>: Against some part of Poland.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>: Who commands them, sir?
<br><br><span class="character ESCORT">SOLDIER</span>: The nephew to old Norway, Fortinbras.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: We'll be cold. The summer won't last.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: It's autumnal.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span> <span class="actionstyle brackets">(examining the ground)</span>: No leaves.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Autumnal-nothing to do with leaves. It is to do with a certain brownness at the edges of the day... Brown
is creeping up on us, take my word for it... Russets and tangerine shades of old gold flushing the very
outside edge of the senses... deep shining ochres, burnt umber and parchments of baked earth-reflecting on itself and through itself, filtering the light. At such times, perhaps, coincidentally, the leaves might fall, somewhere, by repute. Yesterday was blue, like smoke.

BLACKOUT
Act three

Soft sea sounds.
After several seconds of nothing, a voice from the dark .

<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: You can still talk.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: What should I say?
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Don't bother. You can feel, can't you?
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Ah! There's life in me yet!
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: What are you feeling?
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: A leg. Yes, it feels like my leg.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: How does it feel?
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Dead.

<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: No.... I don't think I'd take to it. Sleep all night, can't see a thing all day.... Those eskimos must have a quiet life.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Where?
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: What?
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: I thought you - <span class="actionstyle brackets">(Relapses.)</span> I've lost all capacity for disbelief. I'm not sure that I could even rise to a little
gentle scepticism. <span class="actionstyle brackets">(Pause.)</span>
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Well, shall we stretch our legs? <br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: I don't feel like stretching my legs. <br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: I'll stretch them for you, if you like. <br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: No.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: We could stretch each other's. That way we wouldn't have to go anywhere. <br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span> <span class="actionstyle brackets">(pause)</span>: No, somebody might come in.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: In where?
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Out here.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: In out here?
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: On deck.
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(<span class="character ROS">ROS</span> considers the floor: slaps it.)</span>
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Nice bit of planking, that.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Yes, I'm very fond of boats myself. I like the way they're-contained. You don't have to worry about
which way to go, or whether to go at all-the question doesn't arise, because you're on a boat, aren't you? Boats are safe areas in the game of tag ... the players will hold their positions until the music starts.... I think I'll spend most of my life on boats.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Very healthy.
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(<span class="character ROS">ROS</span> inhales with expectation, exhales with boredom. <span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span> stands up and looks over the audience.)</span>
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: One is free on a boat. For a time. Relatively.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: What's it like?
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Rough.
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(<span class="character ROS">ROS</span> joins him. They look out over the audience.)</span>
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: I think I'm going to be sick.
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(<span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span> licks a finger, holds it up experimentally.)</span>
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Other side, I think.
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(<span class="character ROS">ROS</span> goes upstage: Ideally a sort of upper deck joined to the downstage lower deck by short steps. The umbrella
being on the upper deck. <span class="character ROS">ROS</span> pauses by the umbrella and looks behind it.)</span>
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(<span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span> meanwhile has been resuming his own theme - looking out over the audience - )</span>
Free to move, speak, extemporise, and yet. We have not been cut loose. Our truancy is defined by one fixed
star, and our drift represents merely a slight chance of angle to it: we may seize the moment, toss it around while the moment pass, a short dash here, an exploration there, but we are brought round full circle to face again the single immutable fact - that we, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, are taking Hamlet to England.

<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span> <span class="actionstyle brackets">(unsurprised)</span>: What's he doing? <br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Sleeping.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: It's all right for him.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: What is?
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: He can sleep.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: It's all right for him.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: He's got us now.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: He can sleep.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: It's all done for him.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: He's got us.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: And we've got nothing. <span class="actionstyle brackets">(A cry.)</span> All I ask is our common due!
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: For those in peril of the sea...
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Give us this day our daily cue.

<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: What do you mean?
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Well, nothing is happening.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: We're on a boat.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: I'm aware of that.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span> <span class="actionstyle brackets">(angrily)</span>: Then what do you expect? <span class="actionstyle brackets">(Unhappily.)</span> We act on scraps of information... sifting half-

<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Yes.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: What's the point of that?

<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: How much did he give you?
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Who?
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: The king. He gave us some money. <br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: How much did he give you?
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: I asked you first.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: I got the same as you.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: He wouldn't discriminate between us. <br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: How much did you get?
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: The same.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: How do you know?
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: You just told me - how do you know? <br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: He wouldn't discriminate between us. <br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Even if he could.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Which he never could.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: He couldn't even be sure of mixing us up.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Without mixing us up.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span> <span class="actionstyle brackets">(turning on him furiously)</span>: Why don't you say something original! No wonder the whole thing is so
stagnant! You don't take me up on anything-you just repeat it in a different order.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: I can't think of anything original. I'm only good in support.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: I'm sick of making the running.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span> <span class="actionstyle brackets">(humbly)</span>: It must be your dominant personality. <span class="actionstyle brackets">(Almost in tears.)</span> Oh, what's going to become of us! <span class="actionstyle brackets">(And <span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span> comforts him, all harshness gone.)</span>
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Don't cry... it's all right... there... there, I'll see we're all right. <br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: But we've got nothing to go on, we're out on our own.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: We're on our way to England - we're taking Hamlet there. <br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: What for?
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: What for? Where have you been?
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: When? <span class="actionstyle brackets">(Pause.)</span> We won't know what to do when we get there.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: We take him to the king.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Will he be there?
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: No - the king of England.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: He's expecting us?
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: No.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: He won't know what we're playing at. What are we going to say?
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: We've got a letter. You remember the letter.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Do I?
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Everything is explained in the letter. We count on that.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Is that it, then?
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: What?
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: We take Hamlet to the English king, we hand over the letter – what then? <br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: There may be something in the letter to keep us going a bit.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: And if not?
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Then that's it-we're finished.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: At a loose end?
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Yes.
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(Pause.)</span>
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Are there likely to be loose ends? <span class="actionstyle brackets">(Pause.)</span> Who is the English King?
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: That depends on when we get there.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: What do you think it says?
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Oh... greetings. Expressions of loyalty. Asking of favours, calling in of debts. Obscure promises
balanced by vague threats.... Diplomacy. Regards to the family. <br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: And about Hamlet?
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Oh yes.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: And us-the full background?
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: I should say so.
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(Pause.)</span>
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: So we've got a letter which explains everything.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: You've got it.
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(<span class="character ROS">ROS</span> takes that literally. He starts to pat his pockets, etc.)</span>
What's the matter?
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: The letter.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Have you got it?
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span> <span class="actionstyle brackets">(rising fear)</span>: Have I? <span class="actionstyle brackets">(Searches frantically.)</span> Where would I have put it?
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: You can't have lost it.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: I must have!
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: That's odd-I thought he gave it to me.
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(<span class="character ROS">ROS</span> looks at him hopefully.)</span>
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Perhaps he did.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: But you seemed so sure it was you who hadn't got it.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span> <span class="actionstyle brackets">(high)</span>: It was me who hadn't got it!
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: But if he gave it to me there's no reason why you should have had it in the first place, in which case I don't
see what all the fuss is about you not having it.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span> <span class="actionstyle brackets">(pause)</span>: I admit it's confusing.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: This is all getting rather undisciplined... The boat, the night, the sense of isolation and uncertainty... all
these induce a loosening of the concentration. We must not lose control. Tighten up. Now. Either you
have lost the letter or you didn't have it to lose in the first place, in which case the king never gave it to you, in which case he gave it to me, in which case I would have put it into my inside top pocket in which case <span class="actionstyle brackets">(calmly producing the letter)</span>... it will be... here. <span class="actionstyle brackets">(They smile at each other.)</span> We mustn't drop off like that again.
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(Pause. <span class="character ROS">ROS</span> takes the letter gently from him.)</span>
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Now that we have found it, why were we looking for it? <br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span> <span class="actionstyle brackets">(thinks)</span>: We thought it was lost.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Something else?
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: No.
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(Deflation.)</span>
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Now we've lost the tension.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: What tension?
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: What was the last thing I said before we wandered off?
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: When was that?
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span> <span class="actionstyle brackets">(helplessly)</span>: I can't remember.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span> <span class="actionstyle brackets">(leaping up)</span>: What a shambles! We're just not getting anywhere.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span> <span class="actionstyle brackets">(mournfully)</span>: Not even England. I don't believe in it anyway.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: What?
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: England.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Just a conspiracy of cartographers, you mean?
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: I mean I don't believe it! <span class="actionstyle brackets">(Calmer.)</span> I have no image. I try to picture us arriving, a little harbour perhaps...
roads... inhabitants to point the way... horses on the road... riding for a day or a fortnight and then a palace and the English king,... That would be the logical kind of thing... But my mind remains a blank. No. We're slipping off the map.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Yes... yes... <span class="actionstyle brackets">(Rallying.)</span> But you don't believe anything till it happens. And it has all happened. Hasn't it? <br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: We drift down time, clutching at straws. But what good's a brick to a drowning man?
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Don't give up, we can't be long now.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: We might as well be dead. Do you think death could possibly be a boat?
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: No, no, no... Death is... not. Death isn't. You take my meaning. Death is the ultimate negative. Not-being. You can't not-be on a boat.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: I've frequently not been on boats.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: No, no, no - what you've been is not on boats.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: I wish I was dead. <span class="actionstyle brackets">(Considers the drop.)</span> I could jump over the side. That would put a spoke in their
wheel.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Unless they're counting on it.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: I shall remain on board. That'll put a spoke in their wheel.
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(The futility of it, fury.)</span> All right! We don't question, we don't doubt. We perform. But a line must be drawn
somewhere, and I would like to put it on record that I have no confidence in England. Thank you. <span class="actionstyle brackets">(Thinks about this.)</span> And even if it's true, it'll just be another shambles.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: I don't see why.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span> <span class="actionstyle brackets">(furious)</span>: He won't know what we're talking about - What are we going to say? <br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: We say - Your majesty, we have arrived.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span> <span class="actionstyle brackets">(kingly)</span>: And who are you?
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: We are Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span> <span class="actionstyle brackets">(barks)</span>: Never heard of you!
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Well, we're nobody special -
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span> <span class="actionstyle brackets">(regal and nasty)</span>: What's your game?
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: We've got our instructions -
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: First I've heard of it -
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span> <span class="actionstyle brackets">(angrily)</span>: Let me finish - <span class="actionstyle brackets">(Humble.)</span> We've come from Denmark, <span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: What do you want?
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Nothing-we're delivering Hamlet -
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Who's he?
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span> <span class="actionstyle brackets">(irritated)</span>: You've heard of him--
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Oh, I've heard of him all right and I want nothing to do with it.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: But -
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: You march in here without so much as a by your leave and expect me to take every lunatic you try to pass
off with a lot of unsubstantiated -
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: We've got a letter -
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(<span class="character ROS">ROS</span> snatches it and tears it open.)</span>
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span> <span class="actionstyle brackets">(efficiently)</span>: I see... I see... well, this seems to support your story such as it is - it is an exact command
from the king of Denmark, for several different reasons, importing Denmark's health and England's too, that on the reading of this letter, without delay, I should have Hamlet's head cut off -!
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(<span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span> snatches the letter. <span class="character ROS">ROS</span>, doubletaking, snatches it back, <span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span> snatches it halfback. They read it together, and separate.)</span>
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(Pause.)</span>
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(They are well downstage looking front.)</span>
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: The sun's going down. It will be dark soon.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Do you think so?
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: I was just making conversation. <span class="actionstyle brackets">(Pause.)</span> We're his friends.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: How do you know?
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: From our young days brought up with him.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: You've only got their word for it.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: But that's what we depend on.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Well, yes, and then again no. <span class="actionstyle brackets">(Airily.)</span> Let us keep things in proportion. Assume, if you like, that they're
going to kill him. Well, he is a man, he is mortal, death comes to us all, etcetera, and consequently he
would have died anyway, sooner or later. Or to look at it from the social point of view-he's just one man among many, the loss would be well within reason and convenience. And then again, what is so terrible about death? As Socrates so philosophically put it, since we don't know what death is, it is illogical to fear it. It might be... very nice. Certainly it is a release from the burden of life, and, for the godly, a haven and a reward. Or to look at it another way - we are little men, we don't know the ins and outs of the matter, there are wheels within wheels, etcetera - it would be presumptuous of us to interfere with the designs of fate or even of kings. All in all, I think we'd be well advised to leave well alone. Tie up the letter - there - neatly - like that - They won't notice the broken seal, assuming you were in character.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: But what's the point? <br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Don't apply logic.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: He's done nothing to us. <br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Or justice.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: It's awful.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: But it could have been worse. I was beginning to think it was. <span class="actionstyle brackets">(And his relief comes out in a laugh.)</span> <span class="actionstyle brackets">(Behind them <span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span> appears from behind the umbrella. The light has been going. Slightly. <br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span> is going
to the lantern.)</span>
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: The position as I see it, then. We, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, from our young days brought up with
him, awakened by a man standing on his saddle, are summoned, and arrive, and are instructed to glean what afflicts him and draw him on to pleasures, such as a play, which unfortunately, as it turns out, is abandoned in some confusion owing to certain nuances outside our appreciation - which, among other causes, results in, among other effects, a high, not to say, homicidal, excitement in Hamlet, whom we, in consequence, are escorting, for his own good, to England. Good. We're on top of it now.
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(<span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span> blows out the lantern. The stage goes pitch black.)</span>
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(The Black resolves itself to moonlight, by which <span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span> approaches the sleeping <span class="character ROS">ROS</span> and <span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>.

<span class="actionstyle brackets">(Morning comes.)</span>
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(<span class="character ROS">ROS</span> watches it coming-from the auditorium. Behind him is a gay sight. Beneath the re-tilted umbrella, reclining in a deckchair, wrapped in a rug, reading a book, possibly smoking, sits Hamlet.)</span>
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(<span class="character ROS">ROS</span> watches the morning come, and brighten to high noon.)</span>
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: I'm assuming nothing. <span class="actionstyle brackets">(He stands up. <br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span> wakes.)</span> The position as I see it, then. That's west unless we're off course, in which case it's night; the king gave me the same as you, the king gave you the same as me: the king never gave me the letter, the king gave you the letter, we don't know what's in the letter; we take Hamlet to the English king, it depending on when we get there who he is, and we hand over the letter, which may or
may not have something in it to keep us going, and if not, we are finished and at a loose end, if they have loose ends. We could have done worse. I don't think we missed any chance... Not that we're getting much help. <span class="actionstyle brackets">(He sits down again. They lie down - prone.)</span> If we stopped breathing we'd vanish.
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(The muffled sound of a recorder. They sit up with disproportionate interest.)</span> Here we go.
Yes, but what?
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(They listen to the music.)</span>
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span> <span class="actionstyle brackets">(excitedly)</span>: Out of the void, finally, a sound; while on a boat <span class="actionstyle brackets">(admittedly)</span> outside the action <span class="actionstyle brackets">(admittedly)</span>
the perfect and absolute silence of the wet lazy slap of water against water and the rolling creak of timber-breaks; giving rise at once to the speculation or the assumption or the hope that something is about to happen; a pipe is heard. One of the sailors has pursed his lips against a woodwind, his fingers and thumb governing, shall we say, the ventages, whereupon, giving it breath, let us say, with his mouth, it, the pipe, discourses, as the saying goes, most eloquent music. A thing like that, it could change the course of events.
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(Pause.)</span> Go and see what it is.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: It's someone playing on a pipe. <br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Go and find him.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: And then what?
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: I don't know - request a tune.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: What for?
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Quick-before we lose our momentum.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Why!-something is happening. It had quite escaped my attention!
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(He listens: Makes a stab at an exit. Listens more carefully: Changes direction:)</span>
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(<span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span> takes no notice.)</span>
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(<span class="character ROS">ROS</span> wanders about trying to decide where the music comes from. Finally he tracks it down - unwillingly - to the
middle barrel. There is no getting away from it. He turns to <span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span> who takes no notice. <br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>, during this whole business, never quite breaks into articulate speech. His face and his hands indicate his incredulity. He stands gazing at the middle barrel. The pipe plays on within. He kicks the barrel. The pipe stops. He leaps back towards <span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>. The pipe starts up again. He approaches the barrel cautiously. He lifts the lid. The music is louder. He slams down the lid. The music is softer. He goes back towards <span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>. But a drum starts, muffled. He freezes.
He turns. Considers the left-hand barrel. The drumming goes on within, in time to the flute. He walks back to <span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>. He opens his mouth to speak. Doesn't make it. A lute is heard. He spins round at the third barrel. More instruments join in. Until it is quite inescapable that inside the three barrels, distributed, playing together a familiar tune which has been heard three times before, are the <span class="character TRAGEDIANS">TRAGEDIANS</span>.)</span>
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(They play on.)</span>
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(<span class="character ROS">ROS</span> sits beside <span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>. They stare ahead.)</span>
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(The tune comes to an end.)</span>
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(Pause.)</span>
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: I thought I heard a band. <span class="actionstyle brackets">(In anguish.)</span> Plausibility is all I presume!
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span> <span class="actionstyle brackets">(coda)</span>: Call us this day our daily tune....
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(The lid of the middle barrel flies open and the <span class="character PLAYER">PLAYER</span>'s head pops out.)</span>
<br><br><span class="character PLAYER">PLAYER</span>: Aha! All in the same boat, then! <span class="actionstyle brackets">(He climbs out. He goes round banging on the barrels.)</span> Everybody out!

<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Travelling.
<br><br><span class="character PLAYER">PLAYER</span>: Of course, we haven't got there yet. <br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Are we all right for England?
<br><br><span class="character PLAYER">PLAYER</span>: You look all right to me. I don't think they're very particular in England.

<span class="actionstyle brackets">(To <span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>.)</span> Pleased to see us? <span class="actionstyle brackets">(Pause.)</span> You've come out of it very well, so far.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: And you?
<br><br><span class="character PLAYER">PLAYER</span>: In disfavour. Our play offended the king.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Yes.
<br><br><span class="character PLAYER">PLAYER</span>: Well, he's a second husband himself. Tactless, really.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: It was quite a good play nevertheless.
<br><br><span class="character PLAYER">PLAYER</span>: We never really got going-it was getting quite interesting when they stopped it.
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(Looks up at <span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>.)</span>
That's the way to travel...
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: What were you doing in there?
<br><br><span class="character PLAYER">PLAYER</span>: Hiding. <span class="actionstyle brackets">(Indicating costumes.)</span> We had to run for it just as we were.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Stowaways.
<br><br><span class="character PLAYER">PLAYER</span>: Naturally-we didn't get paid, owing to circumstances ever so slightly beyond our control, and all the
money we had we lost betting on certainties. Life is a gamble, at terrible odds-if it was a bet you wouldn't take it. Did you know that any number doubled is even?
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Is it?
<br><br><span class="character PLAYER">PLAYER</span>: We learn something every day, to our cost. But we troupers just go on and on. Do you know what happens to old actors?
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: What?
<br><br><span class="character PLAYER">PLAYER</span>: Nothing. They're still acting. Surprised, then?
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: What?
<br><br><span class="character PLAYER">PLAYER</span>: Surprised to see us?
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: I knew it wasn't the end.
<br><br><span class="character PLAYER">PLAYER</span>: With practically everyone on his feet. What do you make of it, so far?
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: We haven't got much to go on.
<br><br><span class="character PLAYER">PLAYER</span>: You speak to him?
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: It's possible.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: But it wouldn't make any difference.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: But it's possible.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Pointless.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: It's allowed.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Allowed, yes. We are not restricted. No boundaries have been defined, no inhibitions imposed. We
have, for the while, secured, or blundered into, our release, for the while. Spontaneity and whim are the
order of the day. Other wheels are turning but they are not our concern. We can breathe. We can relax. We can do what we like and say what we like to whomever we like, without restriction.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Within limits, of course.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Certainly within limits.
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(<span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span> comes down to footlights and regards the audience. The others watch but don't speak. <span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>
clears his throat noisily and spits into the audience. A split second later he claps his hand to his eye and wipes himself. He goes back upstage.)</span>
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: A compulsion towards philosophical introspection is his chief characteristic, if I may put it like that. It does not mean he is mad. It does mean he isn't. Very often, it does not mean anything at all. Which may
or may not be a kind of madness.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: It really boils down to symptoms. Pregnant replies, mystic allusions, mistaken identities, arguing his father is his mother, that sort of thing; intimations of suicide, forgoing of exercise, loss of mirth, hints
of claustrophobia not to say delusions of imprisonment; invocations of camels, chameleons, capons, whales, weasels, hawks, handsaws - riddles, quibbles and evasions; amnesia, paranoia, myopia; day-dreaming, hallucinations; stabbing his elders, abusing his parents, insulting his lover, and appearing hatless in public - knock-kneed, droop-stockinged and sighing like a love-sick schoolboy, which at his age is coming on a bit strong.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: And talking to himself.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: And talking to himself.

<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: He's the Player.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: His play offended the king-
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: -offended the king-

<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: -orders his arrest-
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: -so he escapes to England-

<span class="actionstyle brackets">(<span class="character ROS">ROS</span> jumps up.)</span>
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: Incidents! All we get is incidents! Dear God, is it too much to expect a little sustained action?!

the king -

without him.

<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: England! That's a dead end. I never believed in it anyway. <br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: All we've got to do is make our report and that'll be that. Surely.

about, but our movement is contained within a larger one that carries us along as inexorably as the wind and current...
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: They had it in for us, didn't they? Right from the beginning. Who'd have thought that we were so important?
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: But why? Was it all for this? Who are we that so much should converge on our little deaths? <span class="actionstyle brackets">(In anguish to the <span class="character PLAYER">PLAYER</span>.)</span> Who are we?
<br><br><span class="character PLAYER">PLAYER</span>: You are Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. That's enough.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: No - it is not enough. To be told so little - to such an end - and still, finally, to be denied an explanation... <br><br><span class="character PLAYER">PLAYER</span>: In our experience, most things end in death.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span> <span class="actionstyle brackets">(fear, vengeance, scorn)</span>: Your experience?-Actors!
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(He snatches a dagger from the <span class="character PLAYER">PLAYER</span>'s belt and holds the point at the
<span class="character PLAYER">PLAYER</span>'s throat: the <span class="character PLAYER">PLAYER</span> backs and <span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span> advances, speaking more quietly.)</span>
I'm talking about death-and you've never experienced that. And you cannot act it. You die a thousand casual
deaths-with none of that intensity which squeezes out life... and no blood runs cold anywhere. Because even as you die you know that you will come back in a different hat. But no one gets up after death-there is no applause- there is only silence and some second-hand clothes, and that's - death -
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(And he pushes the blade in up to the hilt. The <span class="character PLAYER">PLAYER</span> stands with huge, terrible eyes, clutches at the wound as the blade withdraws: he makes small weeping sounds and falls to his knees, and then right down:)</span>

<span class="actionstyle brackets">(The <span class="character TRAGEDIANS">TRAGEDIANS</span> watch the <span class="character PLAYER">PLAYER</span> die: they watch with some interest.

The <span class="character PLAYER">PLAYER</span> stands up,
brushing himself down.)</span>
<br><br><span class="character PLAYER">PLAYER</span> <span class="actionstyle brackets">(modestly)</span>: Oh, come, come, gentlemen - no flattery - it was merely competent-
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(The tragedians are stilt congratulating him. The <span class="character PLAYER">PLAYER</span> approaches <span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>, who stands rooted, holding the
dagger.)</span>
What did you think? <span class="actionstyle brackets">(Pause.)</span> You see, it is the kind they do believe in - it's what is expected. <span class="actionstyle brackets">(He holds his
hand out for the dagger. <span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span> slowly puts the point of the dagger on to the <span class="character PLAYER">PLAYER</span>'s hand, and pushes ... the blade slides back into the handle.

For a moment you thought I'd - cheated.

<span class="actionstyle brackets">(And the light is fading over the deaths which take place right upstage.)</span>
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(Dying amid the dying-tragically; romantically.)</span> So there's an end to that-it's commonplace: light goes with life, and in the winter of your years the dark comes early...

No... no... not for us, not like that. Dying is not romantic, and death is not a game which will soon be over... Death is not anything ... death is not... It's the absence of presence, nothing more ... the endless time of never coming back ... a gap you can't see, and when the wind blows through it, it makes no sound...
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(The light has gone upstage.

<span class="actionstyle brackets">(Pause.)</span>
What was it all about? When did it begin?
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(Pause, no answer.)</span>
Couldn't we just stay put? I mean no one is going to come on and drag us off.... They Ml just have to wait. We're still young ... fit... we've got years...
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(Pause. No answer.)</span>
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(A cry.)</span> We've nothing wrong! We didn't harm anyone. Did we? <br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: I can't remember.
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(<span class="character ROS">ROS</span> pulls himself together.)</span>
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROS</span>: All right, then. I don't care. I've had enough. To tell you the truth, I'm relieved.
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(And he disappears from view.)</span>
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(<span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span> does not notice.)</span>
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUIL</span>: Our names shouted in a certain dawn ... a message ... a summons... there must have been a
moment, at the beginning, where we could have said-no. But somehow we missed it. <span class="actionstyle brackets">(He looks round and sees he is alone.)</span>
Rosen--?
Guil--?
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(He gathers himself.)</span>
Well, we'll know better next time. Now you see me, now you -
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(And disappears.)</span>
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(Immediately the whole stage is lit up, revealing, upstage, arranged in the approximate positions last held by the
dead <span class="character TRAGEDIANS">TRAGEDIANS</span>, the tableau of court and corpses which is the last scene of "Hamlet".)</span>
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(That is: The <span class="character KING">KING</span>, <span class="character QUEEN">QUEEN</span>, <span class="character LAERTES">LAERTES</span> and <span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span> all dead. <span class="character HORATIO">HORATIO</span> holds <span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>. all dead.
<span class="character FORTINBRAS">FORTINBRAS</span> is
there.)</span>
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(So are two <span class="character AMBASSADORS">AMBASSADORS</span> from England.)</span>
<br><br><span class="character AMBASSADORS">AMBASSADORS</span>: The signal is dismal;
and our affairs from England come too late.
The ears are senseless that should give us hearing to
tell him his commandment is fulfilled, that
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead.
Where should we have our thanks?
<br><br><!-- <span class="character ros_anchor" id="ros_anchor3"> -->HORATIO<!-- </span> -->: Not from his mouth, had it the ability of life to thank you: He never gave commandment for their
death. But since, so jump upon this bloody question, you from the Polack wars, and you from England, are here arrived, give order that these bodies high on a stage be placed to the view; and let me speak to the yet unknowing world how these things came about: so shall you hear of carnal, bloody and unnatural acts, of accidental judgements, casual slaughters, of deaths put on by cunning and forced cause, and, in this upshot, purposes mistook fallen on the inventors' heads: all this can I truly deliver.
<span class="actionstyle brackets">(But during the above speech the play fades, overtaken by dark and music.)</span> THE END</p>

SCENE I. Elsinore. A platform before the castle.

<br><span class="actionstyle brackets"><br><br><span class="character FRANCISCO">FRANCISCO</span> at his post. Enter to him <!-- <span class="character ham_anchor" id="ham_anchor1"> -->BERNARDO<!-- </span> -->.</span>
<br><br><span class="character BERNARDO">BERNARDO</span>:
Who's there?<br>
<br><br><span class="character FRANCISCO">FRANCISCO</span>:
Nay, answer me: stand, and unfold yourself.<br>
<br><br><span class="character BERNARDO">BERNARDO</span>:
Long live the king!<br>
<br><br><span class="character FRANCISCO">FRANCISCO</span>:
Bernardo?<br>
<br><br><span class="character BERNARDO">BERNARDO</span>:
He.<br>
<br><br><span class="character FRANCISCO">FRANCISCO</span>:
You come most carefully upon your hour.<br>
<br><br><span class="character BERNARDO">BERNARDO</span>:
'Tis now struck twelve;<br> get thee to bed, Francisco.<br>
<br><br><span class="character FRANCISCO">FRANCISCO</span>:
For this relief much thanks: 'tis bitter cold,<br>
And I am sick at heart.<br>
<br><br><span class="character BERNARDO">BERNARDO</span>:
Have you had quiet guard?<br>
<br><br><span class="character FRANCISCO">FRANCISCO</span>:
Not a mouse stirring.<br>
<br><br><span class="character BERNARDO">BERNARDO</span>:
Well, good night.<br>
If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,<br>
The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.<br>
<br><br><span class="character FRANCISCO">FRANCISCO</span>:
I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who's there?<br>
<br><span class="actionstyle brackets">Enter <span class="character HORATIO">HORATIO</span> and <span class="character MARCELLUS">MARCELLUS</span>.</span>

<br><br><span class="character HORATIO">HORATIO</span>:
Friends to this ground.<br>
<br><br><span class="character MARCELLUS">MARCELLUS</span>:
And liegemen to the Dane.<br>
<br><br><span class="character FRANCISCO">FRANCISCO</span>:
Give you good night.<br>
<br><br><span class="character MARCELLUS">MARCELLUS</span>:
O, farewell, honest soldier:<br>
Who hath relieved you?<br>
<br><br><span class="character FRANCISCO">FRANCISCO</span>:
Bernardo has my place.<br>
Give you good night.<br>
<br><span class="actionstyle brackets">Exit.</span>

<br><br><span class="character MARCELLUS">MARCELLUS</span>:
Holla! Bernardo!<br>
<br><br><span class="character BERNARDO">BERNARDO</span>:
Say,<br>
What, is Horatio there?<br>
<br><br><span class="character HORATIO">HORATIO</span>:
A piece of him.<br>
<br><br><span class="character BERNARDO">BERNARDO</span>:
Welcome, Horatio: welcome, good Marcellus.<br>
<br><br><span class="character MARCELLUS">MARCELLUS</span>:
What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?<br>
<br><br><span class="character BERNARDO">BERNARDO</span>:
I have seen nothing.<br>
<br><br><span class="character MARCELLUS">MARCELLUS</span>:
Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,<br>
And will not let belief take hold of him<br>
Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us:<br>
Therefore I have entreated him along<br>
With us to watch the minutes of this night;<br>
That if again this apparition come,<br>
He may approve our eyes and speak to it.<br>
<br><br><span class="character HORATIO">HORATIO</span>:
Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.<br>
<br><br><span class="character BERNARDO">BERNARDO</span>:
Sit down awhile;<br>
And let us once again assail your ears,<br>
That are so fortified against our story<br>
What we have two nights seen.<br>
<br><br><span class="character HORATIO">HORATIO</span>:
Well, sit we down,<br>
And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.<br>
<br><br><span class="character BERNARDO">BERNARDO</span>:
Last night of all,<br>
When yond same star that's westward from the pole<br>
Had made his course to illume that part of heaven<br>
Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,<br>
The bell then beating one,– <br>
<br><span class="actionstyle brackets">Enter Ghost</span>

<br><br><span class="character MARCELLUS">MARCELLUS</span>:
Peace, break thee off;<br> look, where it comes again!<br>
<br><br><span class="character BERNARDO">BERNARDO</span>:
In the same figure, like the king that's dead.<br>
<br><br><span class="character MARCELLUS">MARCELLUS</span>:
Thou art a scholar;<br> speak to it, Horatio.<br>
<br><br><span class="character BERNARDO">BERNARDO</span>:
Looks it not like the king? mark it, Horatio.<br>
<br><br><span class="character HORATIO">HORATIO</span>:
Most like: it harrows me with fear and wonder.
<br><br><span class="character BERNARDO">BERNARDO</span>:
It would be spoke to.
<br><br><span class="character MARCELLUS">MARCELLUS</span>:
Question it, Horatio.
<br><br><span class="character HORATIO">HORATIO</span>:
What art thou that usurp'st this time of night,<br>
Together with that fair and warlike form<br>
In which the majesty of buried Denmark<br>
Did sometimes march? by heaven I charge thee, speak!<br>
<br><br><span class="character MARCELLUS">MARCELLUS</span>:
It is offended.
<br><br><span class="character BERNARDO">BERNARDO</span>:
See, it stalks away!
<br><br><span class="character HORATIO">HORATIO</span>:
Stay! speak, speak! I charge thee, speak!
<br><span class="actionstyle brackets">Exit Ghost</span>

<br><br><span class="character MARCELLUS">MARCELLUS</span>:
'Tis gone, and will not answer.
<br><br><span class="character BERNARDO">BERNARDO</span>:
How now, Horatio! you tremble and look pale:<br>
Is not this something more than fantasy?<br>
What think you on't?<br>
<br><br><span class="character HORATIO">HORATIO</span>:
Before my God, I might not this believe<br>
Without the sensible and true avouch<br>
Of mine own eyes.<br>
<br><br><span class="character MARCELLUS">MARCELLUS</span>:
Is it not like the king?
<br><br><span class="character HORATIO">HORATIO</span>:
As thou art to thyself:<br>
Such was the very armour he had on<br>
When he the ambitious Norway combated;<br>
So frown'd he once, when, in an angry parle,<br>
He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.<br>
'Tis strange.
<br><br><span class="character MARCELLUS">MARCELLUS</span>:
Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,<br>
With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.<br>
<br><br><span class="character HORATIO">HORATIO</span>:
In what particular thought to work I know not;<br>
But in the gross and scope of my opinion,<br>
This bodes some strange eruption to our state.
<br><br><span class="character MARCELLUS">MARCELLUS</span>:
Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows,<br>
Why this same strict and most observant watch<br>
So nightly toils the subject of the land,<br>
And why such daily cast of brazen cannon,<br>
And foreign mart for implements of war;<br>
Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task<br>
Does not divide the Sunday from the week;<br>
What might be toward, that this sweaty haste<br>
Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day:<br>
Who is't that can inform me?<br>
<br><br><span class="character HORATIO">HORATIO</span>:
That can I;<br>
At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,<br>
Whose image even but now appear'd to us,<br>
Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,<br>
Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,<br>
Dared to the combat;<br> in which our valiant Hamlet--<br>
For so this side of our known world esteem'd him--<br>
Did slay this Fortinbras;<br> who by a seal'd compact,<br>
Well ratified by law and heraldry,<br>
Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands<br>
Which he stood seized of, to the conqueror:<br>
Against the which, a moiety competent<br>
Was gaged by our king; which had return'd<br>
To the inheritance of Fortinbras,<br>
Had he been vanquisher; as, by the same covenant,<br>
And carriage of the article design'd,<br>
His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,<br>
Of unimproved mettle hot and full,<br>
Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there<br>
Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,<br>
For food and diet, to some enterprise<br>
That hath a stomach in't; which is no other--<br>
As it doth well appear unto our state--<br>
But to recover of us, by strong hand<br>
And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands<br>
So by his father lost: and this, I take it,<br>
Is the main motive of our preparations,<br>
The source of this our watch and the chief head<br>
Of this post-haste and romage in the land.<br>
<br><br><span class="character BERNARDO">BERNARDO</span>:
I think it be no other but e'en so:<br>
Well may it sort that this portentous figure<br>
Comes armed through our watch; so like the king<br>
That was and is the question of these wars.<br>
<br><br><span class="character HORATIO">HORATIO</span>:
A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.<br>
In the most high and palmy state of Rome,<br>
A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,<br>
The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead<br>
Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets:<br>
As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,<br>
Disasters in the sun;<br> and the moist star<br>
Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands<br>
Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse:<br>
And even the like precurse of fierce events,<br>
As harbingers preceding still the fates<br>
And prologue to the omen coming on,<br>
Have heaven and earth together demonstrated<br>
Unto our climatures and countrymen.--<br>
But soft, behold! lo, where it comes again!<br>
Re-enter Ghost<br>

I'll cross it, though it blast me. Stay, illusion!<br>
If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,<br>
Speak to me:<br>
If there be any good thing to be done,<br>
That may to thee do ease and grace to me,<br>
Speak to me:<br>
Cock crows<br>

If thou art privy to thy country's fate,<br>
Which, happily, foreknowing may avoid, O, speak!<br>
Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life<br>
Extorted treasure in the womb of earth,<br>
For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death,<br>
Speak of it: stay, and speak! Stop it, Marcellus.<br>
<br><br><span class="character MARCELLUS">MARCELLUS</span>:
Shall I strike at it with my partisan?<br>
<br><br><span class="character HORATIO">HORATIO</span>:
Do, if it will not stand.<br>
<br><br><span class="character BERNARDO">BERNARDO</span>:
'Tis here!<br>
<br><br><span class="character HORATIO">HORATIO</span>:
'Tis here!<br>
<br><br><span class="character MARCELLUS">MARCELLUS</span>:
'Tis gone!<br>
<br><span class="actionstyle brackets"><br><span class="actionstyle brackets">Exit.</span> Ghost</span>
<br><br>
We do it wrong, being so majestical,<br>
To offer it the show of violence;<br>
For it is, as the air, invulnerable,<br>
And our vain blows malicious mockery.<br>
<br><br><span class="character BERNARDO">BERNARDO</span>:
It was about to speak, when the cock crew.<br>
<br><br><span class="character HORATIO">HORATIO</span>:
And then it started like a guilty thing<br>
Upon a fearful summons. I have heard,<br>
The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,<br>
Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat<br>
Awake the god of day;<br> and, at his warning,<br>
Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,<br>
The extravagant and erring spirit hies<br>
To his confine: and of the truth herein<br>
This present object made probation.<br>
<br><br><span class="character MARCELLUS">MARCELLUS</span>:
It faded on the crowing of the cock.<br>
Some say that ever 'gainst that season comes<br>
Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,<br>
The bird of dawning singeth all night long:<br>
And then, they say, no spirit dares stir abroad;<br>
The nights are wholesome;<br> then no planets strike,<br>
No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,<br>
So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.<br>
<br><br><span class="character HORATIO">HORATIO</span>:
So have I heard and do in part believe it.<br>
But, look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,<br>
Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill:<br>
Break we our watch up;<br> and by my advice,<br>
Let us impart what we have seen to-night<br>
Unto young Hamlet;<br> for, upon my life,<br>
This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.<br>
Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,<br>
As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?<br>
<br><br><span class="character MARCELLUS">MARCELLUS</span>:
Let's do't, I pray;<br> and I this morning know<br>
Where we shall find him most conveniently.<br>
<br><span class="actionstyle brackets">Exeunt</span>
<br><br>
SCENE II. A room of state in the castle.<br>

<br><span class="actionstyle brackets">Enter  <span class="character KING">KING CLAUDIUS</span>, <span class="character QUEEN">QUEEN GERTRUDE</span>, <span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>, <span class="character POLONIUS">POLONIUS</span>, <span class="character LAERTES">LAERTES</span>, <span class="character VOLTIMAND">VOLTIMAND</span>, <span class="character CORNELIUS">CORNELIUS</span>, Lords, and Attendants</span>.<br>
 <br><br><span class="character KING">KING CLAUDIUS</span>:
Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death<br>
The memory be green, and that it us befitted<br>
To bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom<br>
To be contracted in one brow of woe,<br>
Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature<br>
That we with wisest sorrow think on him,<br>
Together with remembrance of ourselves.<br>
Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,<br>
The imperial jointress to this warlike state,<br>
Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,--<br>
With an auspicious and a dropping eye,<br>
With mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage,<br>
In equal scale weighing delight and dole,--<br>
Taken to wife: nor have we herein barr'd<br>
Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone<br>
With this affair along. For all, our thanks.<br>
Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,<br>
Holding a weak supposal of our worth,<br>
Or thinking by our late dear brother's death<br>
Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,<br>
Colleagued with the dream of his advantage,<br>
He hath not fail'd to pester us with message,<br>
Importing the surrender of those lands<br>
Lost by his father, with all bonds of law,<br>
To our most valiant brother. So much for him.<br>
Now for ourself and for this time of meeting:<br>
Thus much the business is: we have here writ<br>
To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,--<br>
Who, impotent and bed-rid, scarcely hears<br>
Of this his nephew's purpose,--to suppress<br>
His further gait herein;<br> in that the levies,<br>
The lists and full proportions, are all made<br>
Out of his subject: and we here dispatch<br>
You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltimand,<br>
For bearers of this greeting to old Norway;<br>
Giving to you no further personal power<br>
To business with the king, more than the scope<br>
Of these delated articles allow.<br>
Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.<br>
<br><br><span class="character CORNELIUS">CORNELIUS</span>, <span class="character VOLTIMAND">VOLTIMAND</span>:
In that and all things will we show our duty.<br>
 <br><br><span class="character KING">KING CLAUDIUS</span>:
We doubt it nothing: heartily farewell.<br>
<br><span class="actionstyle brackets">Exeunt <span class="character VOLTIMAND">VOLTIMAND</span> and <span class="character CORNELIUS">CORNELIUS</span>.</span>

And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?<br>
You told us of some suit;<br> what is't, Laertes?<br>
You cannot speak of reason to the Dane,<br>
And loose your voice: what wouldst thou beg, Laertes,<br>
That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?<br>
The head is not more native to the heart,<br>
The hand more instrumental to the mouth,<br>
Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.<br>
What wouldst thou have, Laertes?<br>
<br><br><span class="character LAERTES">LAERTES</span>:
My dread lord,<br>
Your leave and favour to return to France;<br>
From whence though willingly I came to Denmark,<br>
To show my duty in your coronation,<br>
Yet now, I must confess, that duty done,<br>
My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France<br>
And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.<br>
 <br><br><span class="character KING">KING CLAUDIUS</span>:
Have you your father's leave? What says Polonius?<br>
<br><br><span class="character POLONIUS">LORD POLONIUS</span>:
He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave<br>
By laboursome petition, and at last<br>
Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent:<br>
I do beseech you, give him leave to go.<br>
 <br><br><span class="character KING">KING CLAUDIUS</span>:
Take thy fair hour, Laertes;<br> time be thine,<br>
And thy best graces spend it at thy will!<br>
But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son,--<br>
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
<span class="actionstyle brackets">[Aside]</span> A little more than kin, and less than kind.<br>
 <br><br><span class="character KING">KING CLAUDIUS</span>:
How is it that the clouds still hang on you?<br>
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Not so, my lord;<br> I am too much i' the sun.<br>
<br><br><span class="character QUEEN">QUEEN GERTRUDE</span>:
Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,<br>
And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.<br>
Do not for ever with thy vailed lids<br>
Seek for thy noble father in the dust:<br>
Thou know'st 'tis common;<br> all that lives must die,<br>
Passing through nature to eternity.<br>
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Ay, madam, it is common.<br>
<br><br><span class="character QUEEN">QUEEN GERTRUDE</span>:
If it be,<br>
Why seems it so particular with thee?<br>
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Seems, madam! nay it is;<br> I know not 'seems.'<br>
'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,<br>
Nor customary suits of solemn black,<br>
Nor windy suspiration of forced breath,<br>
No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,<br>
Nor the dejected 'havior of the visage,<br>
Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,<br>
That can denote me truly: these indeed seem,<br>
For they are actions that a man might play:<br>
But I have that within which passeth show;<br>
These but the trappings and the suits of woe.<br>
 <br><br><span class="character KING">KING CLAUDIUS</span>:
'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,<br>
To give these mourning duties to your father:<br>
But, you must know, your father lost a father;<br>
That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound<br>
In filial obligation for some term<br>
To do obsequious sorrow: but to persever<br>
In obstinate condolement is a course<br>
Of impious stubbornness;<br> 'tis unmanly grief;<br>
It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,<br>
A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,<br>
An understanding simple and unschool'd:<br>
For what we know must be and is as common<br>
As any the most vulgar thing to sense,<br>
Why should we in our peevish opposition<br>
Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,<br>
A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,<br>
To reason most absurd: whose common theme<br>
Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,<br>
From the first corse till he that died to-day,
<br>'This must be so.' We pray you, throw to earth
<br>This unprevailing woe, and think of us
As of a father: for let the world take note,<br>
You are the most immediate to our throne;<br>
And with no less nobility of love<br>
Than that which dearest father bears his son,<br>
Do I impart toward you. For your intent<br>
In going back to school in Wittenberg,<br>
It is most retrograde to our desire:<br>
And we beseech you, bend you to remain<br>
Here, in the cheer and comfort of our eye,<br>
Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.<br>
<br><br><span class="character QUEEN">QUEEN GERTRUDE</span>:
Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet:<br>
I pray thee, stay with us;<br> go not to Wittenberg.<br>
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
I shall in all my best obey you, madam.<br>
 <br><br><span class="character KING">KING CLAUDIUS</span>:
Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply:<br>
Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come;<br>
This gentle and unforced accord of Hamlet<br>
Sits smiling to my heart: in grace whereof,<br>
No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day,<br>
But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,<br>
And the king's rouse the heavens all bruit again,<br>
Re-speaking earthly thunder. Come away.<br>

O, that this too too solid flesh would melt<br>
Thaw and resolve itself into a dew!<br>
Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd<br>
His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!<br>
How weary, stale, flat and unprofitable,<br>
Seem to me all the uses of this world!<br>
Fie on't! ah fie! 'tis an unweeded garden,<br>
That grows to seed;<br> things rank and gross in nature<br>
Possess it merely. That it should come to this!<br>
But two months dead: nay, not so much, not two:<br>
So excellent a king;<br> that was, to this,<br>
Hyperion to a satyr;<br> so loving to my mother<br>
That he might not beteem the winds of heaven<br>
Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!<br>
Must I remember? why, she would hang on him,<br>
As if increase of appetite had grown<br>
By what it fed on: and yet, within a month<br>
Let me not think on't Frailty, thy name is woman!<br>
A little month, or ere those shoes were old<br>
With which she follow'd my poor father's body,<br>
Like Niobe, all tears:why she, even she<br>
O, God! a beast, that wants discourse of reason,<br>
Would have mourn'd longer married with my uncle,<br>
My father's brother, but no more like my father<br>
Than I to Hercules: within a month:<br>
Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears<br>
Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,<br>
She married. O, most wicked speed, to post<br>
With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!<br>
It is not nor it cannot come to good:<br>
But break, my heart;<br> for I must hold my tongue.

Hail to your lordship!<br>
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
I am glad to see you well:<br>
Horatio,--or I do forget myself.
<br><br><span class="character HORATIO">HORATIO</span>:
The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.<br>
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Sir, my good friend;<br> I'll change that name with you:<br>
And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio? Marcellus?<br>
<br><br><span class="character MARCELLUS">MARCELLUS</span>:
My good lord--<br>
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
I am very glad to see you. Good even, sir.<br>
But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?<br>
<br><br><span class="character HORATIO">HORATIO</span>:
A truant disposition, good my lord.<br>
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
I would not hear your enemy say so,<br>
Nor shall you do mine ear that violence,<br>
To make it truster of your own report<br>

But what is your affair in Elsinore?<br>

My lord, I came to see your father's funeral.<br>
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
I pray thee, do not mock me, fellow-student;<br>
I think it was to see my mother's wedding.<br>
<br><br><span class="character HORATIO">HORATIO</span>:
Indeed, my lord, it follow'd hard upon.<br>
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Thrift, thrift, Horatio! the funeral baked meats<br>
Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.<br>
Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven<br>

Where, my lord?<br>
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
In my mind's eye, Horatio.<br>
<br><br><span class="character HORATIO">HORATIO</span>:
I saw him once;<br> he was a goodly king.<br>
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
He was a man, take him for all in all,<br>
I shall not look upon his like again.<br>
<br><br><span class="character HORATIO">HORATIO</span>:
My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.<br>
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Saw? who?<br>
<br><br><span class="character HORATIO">HORATIO</span>:
My lord, the king your father.<br>

The king my father!<br>
<br><br><span class="character HORATIO">HORATIO</span>:
Season your admiration for awhile<br>
With an attent ear, till I may deliver,<br>
Upon the witness of these gentlemen,<br>
This marvel to you.<br>
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
For God's love, let me hear.<br>
<br><br><span class="character HORATIO">HORATIO</span>:
Two nights together had these gentlemen,<br>
Marcellus and Bernardo, on their watch,In the dead vast and middle of the night,<br>
Been thus encounter'd. A figure like your father,<br>
Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,<br>
Appears before them, and with solemn march<br>
Goes slow and stately by them: thrice he walk'd<br>
By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes,<br>
Within his truncheon's length; whilst they, distilled<br>
Almost to jelly with the act of fear,<br>
Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me<br>
In dreadful secrecy impart they did;<br>
And I with them the third night kept the watch;<br>
Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time,<br>
Form of the thing, each word made true and good,<br>
The apparition comes: I knew your father;<br>
These hands are not more like.<br>
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
But where was this?<br>
<br><br><span class="character MARCELLUS">MARCELLUS</span>:
My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.<br>
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Did you not speak to it?<br>
<br><br><span class="character HORATIO">HORATIO</span>:
My lord, I did;<br>
But answer made it none: yet once methought<br>
It lifted up its head and did address<br>
Itself to motion, like as it would speak;<br>
But even then the morning cock crew loud,<br>
And at the sound it shrunk in haste away,<br>
And vanish'd from our sight.<br>
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
'Tis very strange.
<br><br><span class="character HORATIO">HORATIO</span>:
As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;<br>
And we did think it writ down in our duty<br>
To let you know of it.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Indeed, indeed, sirs, but this troubles me.<br>
Hold you the watch to-night?
<br><br><span class="character MARCELLUS">MARCELLUS</span>,<span class="character BERNARDO">BERNARDO</span>:
We do, my lord.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Arm'd, say you?
<br><br><span class="character MARCELLUS">MARCELLUS</span>,<span class="character BERNARDO">BERNARDO</span>:
Arm'd, my lord.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
From top to toe?
<br><br><span class="character MARCELLUS">MARCELLUS</span>,<span class="character BERNARDO">BERNARDO</span>:
My lord, from head to foot.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Then saw you not his face?
<br><br><span class="character HORATIO">HORATIO</span>:
O, yes, my lord;<br> he wore his beaver up.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
What, look'd he frowningly?
<br><br><span class="character HORATIO">HORATIO</span>:
A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Pale or red?
<br><br><span class="character HORATIO">HORATIO</span>:
Nay, very pale.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
And fix'd his eyes upon you?
<br><br><span class="character HORATIO">HORATIO</span>:
Most constantly.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
I would I had been there.
<br><br><span class="character HORATIO">HORATIO</span>:
It would have much amazed you.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Very like, very like. Stay'd it long?
<br><br><span class="character HORATIO">HORATIO</span>:
While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.
<br><br><span class="character MARCELLUS">MARCELLUS</span>,<span class="character BERNARDO">BERNARDO</span>:
Longer, longer.
<br><br><span class="character HORATIO">HORATIO</span>:
Not when I saw't.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
His beard was grizzled--no?
<br><br><span class="character HORATIO">HORATIO</span>:
It was, as I have seen it in his life,
A sable silver'd.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
I will watch to-night;<br>
Perchance 'twill walk again.
<br><br><span class="character HORATIO">HORATIO</span>:
I warrant it will.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
If it assume my noble father's person,<br>
I'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape<br>
And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,<br>
If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight,<br>
Let it be tenable in your silence still;<br>
And whatsoever else shall hap to-night,<br>
Give it an understanding, but no tongue:<br>
I will requite your loves. So, fare you well:<br>
Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve,<br>
I'll visit you.<br>
All<br>
Our duty to your honour.

SCENE III. A room in Polonius' house.

<span class="actionstyle brackets">Enter <span class="character LAERTES">LAERTES</span> and <span class="character OPHELIA">OPHELIA</span></span>
<br><br><span class="character LAERTES">LAERTES</span>:
My necessaries are embark'd: farewell:<br>
And, sister, as the winds give benefit<br>
And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,<br>
But let me hear from you.<br>
<br><br><span class="character OPHELIA">OPHELIA</span>:
Do you doubt that?
<br><br><span class="character LAERTES">LAERTES</span>:
For Hamlet and the trifling of his favour,<br>
Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood,<br>
A violet in the youth of primy nature,<br>
Forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting,<br>
The perfume and suppliance of a minute; No more.<br>
<br><br><span class="character OPHELIA">OPHELIA</span>:
No more but so?
<br><br><span class="character LAERTES">LAERTES</span>:
Think it no more;<br>
For nature, crescent, does not grow alone<br>
In thews and bulk, but, as this temple waxes,<br>
The inward service of the mind and soul<br>
Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,<br>
And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch<br>
The virtue of his will: but you must fear,<br>
His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;<br>
For he himself is subject to his birth:<br>
He may not, as unvalued persons do,<br>
Carve for himself; for on his choice depends<br>
The safety and health of this whole state;<br>
And therefore must his choice be circumscribed<br>
Unto the voice and yielding of that body<br>
Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,<br>
It fits your wisdom so far to believe it<br>
As he in his particular act and place<br>
May give his saying deed; which is no further<br>
Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.<br>
Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain,<br>
If with too credent ear you list his songs,<br>
Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open<br>
To his unmaster'd importunity.<br>
Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,<br>
And keep you in the rear of your affection,<br>
Out of the shot and danger of desire.<br>
The chariest maid is prodigal enough,<br>
If she unmask her beauty to the moon:<br>
Virtue itself 'scapes not calumnious strokes:<br>
The canker galls the infants of the spring,<br>
Too oft before their buttons be disclosed,<br>
And in the morn and liquid dew of youth<br>
Contagious blastments are most imminent.<br>
Be wary then;<br> best safety lies in fear:<br>
Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.
<br><br><span class="character OPHELIA">OPHELIA</span>:
I shall the effect of this good lesson keep,<br>
As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,<br>
Do not, as some ungracious pastors do,<br>
Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven;<br>
Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,<br>
Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads,<br>
And recks not his own rede.
<br><br><span class="character LAERTES">LAERTES</span>:
O, fear me not.<br>
I stay too long: but here my father comes.
Enter <span class="character POLONIUS">POLONIUS</span>:

A double blessing is a double grace,<br>
Occasion smiles upon a second leave.
<br><br><span class="character POLONIUS">LORD POLONIUS</span>:
Yet here, Laertes! aboard, aboard, for shame!<br>
The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,<br>
And you are stay'd for. There; my blessing with thee!<br>
And these few precepts in thy memory<br>
See thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,<br>
Nor any unproportioned thought his act.<br>
Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.<br>
Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,<br>
Grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel;<br>
But do not dull thy palm with entertainment<br>
Of each new-hatch'd, unfledged comrade. Beware<br>
Of entrance to a quarrel, but being in,<br>
Bear't that the opposed may beware of thee.<br>
Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice;<br>
Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.<br>
Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,<br>
But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;<br>
For the apparel oft proclaims the man,<br>
And they in France of the best rank and station<br>
Are of a most select and generous chief in that.<br>
Neither a borrower nor a lender be;<br>
For loan oft loses both itself and friend,<br>
And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.<br>
This above all: to thine ownself be true,<br>
And it must follow, as the night the day,<br>
Thou canst not then be false to any man.<br>
Farewell: my blessing season this in thee!
<br><br><span class="character LAERTES">LAERTES</span>:
Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.
<br><br><span class="character POLONIUS">LORD POLONIUS</span>:
The time invites you; go; your servants tend.
<br><br><span class="character LAERTES">LAERTES</span>:
Farewell, Ophelia; and remember well<br>
What I have said to you.
<br><br><span class="character OPHELIA">OPHELIA</span>:
'Tis in my memory lock'd,<br>
And you yourself shall keep the key of it.
<br><br><span class="character LAERTES">LAERTES</span>:
Farewell.
<br><span class="actionstyle brackets">Exit.</span>

<br><br><span class="character POLONIUS">LORD POLONIUS</span>:
What is't, Ophelia, be hath said to you?
<br><br><span class="character OPHELIA">OPHELIA</span>:
So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.
<br><br><span class="character POLONIUS">LORD POLONIUS</span>:
Marry, well bethought:<br>
'Tis told me, he hath very oft of late<br>
Given private time to you; and you yourself<br>
Have of your audience been most free and bounteous:<br>
If it be so, as so 'tis put on me,<br>
And that in way of caution, I must tell you,<br>
You do not understand yourself so clearly<br>
As it behoves my daughter and your honour.<br>
What is between you? give me up the truth.
<br><br><span class="character OPHELIA">OPHELIA</span>:
He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders<br>
Of his affection to me.
<br><br><span class="character POLONIUS">LORD POLONIUS</span>:
Affection! pooh! you speak like a green girl,<br>
Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.<br>
Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?
<br><br><span class="character OPHELIA">OPHELIA</span>:
I do not know, my lord, what I should think.
<br><br><span class="character POLONIUS">LORD POLONIUS</span>:
Marry, I'll teach you: think yourself a baby;<br>
That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay,<br>
Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly;<br>
Or--not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,<br>
Running it thus--you'll tender me a fool.
<br><br><span class="character OPHELIA">OPHELIA</span>:
My lord, he hath importuned me with love<br>
In honourable fashion.
<br><br><span class="character POLONIUS">LORD POLONIUS</span>:
Ay, fashion you may call it;<br> go to, go to.
<br><br><span class="character OPHELIA">OPHELIA</span>:
And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,<br>
With almost all the holy vows of heaven.
<br><br><span class="character POLONIUS">LORD POLONIUS</span>:
Ay, springes to catch woodcocks. I do know,<br>
When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul<br>
Lends the tongue vows: these blazes, daughter,<br>
Giving more light than heat, extinct in both,<br>
Even in their promise, as it is a-making,<br>
You must not take for fire. From this time<br>
Be somewhat scanter of your maiden presence;<br>
Set your entreatments at a higher rate<br>
Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,<br>
Believe so much in him, that he is young<br>
And with a larger tether may he walk<br>
Than may be given you: in few, Ophelia,<br>
Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers,<br>
Not of that dye which their investments show,<br>
But mere implorators of unholy suits,<br>
Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds,<br>
The better to beguile. This is for all:<br>
I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth,<br>
Have you so slander any moment leisure,<br>
As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.<br>
Look to't, I charge you: come your ways.
<br><br><span class="character OPHELIA">OPHELIA</span>:
I shall obey, my lord.
<br><span class="actionstyle brackets">Exeunt</span>

SCENE IV. The platform.

<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
The air bites shrewdly;<br> it is very cold.
<br><br><span class="character HORATIO">HORATIO</span>:
It is a nipping and an eager air.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
What hour now?
<br><br><span class="character HORATIO">HORATIO</span>:
I think it lacks of twelve.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
No, it is struck.
<br><br><span class="character HORATIO">HORATIO</span>:
Indeed? I heard it not: then it draws near the season<br>
Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.<br>
A flourish of trumpets, and ordnance shot off, within<br><br>

What does this mean, my lord?
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
The king doth wake to-night and takes his rouse,<br>
Keeps wassail, and the swaggering up-spring reels;<br>
And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,<br>
The kettle-drum and trumpet thus bray out<br>
The triumph of his pledge.
<br><br><span class="character HORATIO">HORATIO</span>:
Is it a custom?
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Ay, marry, is't:<br>
But to my mind, though I am native here<br>
And to the manner born, it is a custom<br>
More honour'd in the breach than the observance.<br>
This heavy-headed revel east and west<br>
Makes us traduced and tax'd of other nations:<br>
They clepe us drunkards, and with swinish phrase<br>
Soil our addition; and indeed it takes<br>
From our achievements, though perform'd at height,<br>
The pith and marrow of our attribute.<br>
So, oft it chances in particular men,<br>
That for some vicious mole of nature in them,<br>
As, in their birth wherein they are not guilty,<br>
Since nature cannot choose his origin<br>
By the o'ergrowth of some complexion,<br>
Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason,<br>
Or by some habit that too much o'er-leavens<br>
The form of plausive manners, that these men,<br>
Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,<br>
Being nature's livery, or fortune's star,<br>
Their virtues else be they as pure as grace,<br>
As infinite as man may undergo<br>
Shall in the general censure take corruption<br>
From that particular fault: the dram of eale<br>
Doth all the noble substance of a doubt<br>
To his own scandal.
<br><br><span class="character HORATIO">HORATIO</span>:
Look, my lord, it comes!
<br><span class="actionstyle brackets">Enter Ghost</span>

<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Angels and ministers of grace defend us!<br>
Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd,<br>
Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell,<br>
Be thy intents wicked or charitable,<br>
Thou comest in such a questionable shape<br>
That I will speak to thee: I'll call thee Hamlet,<br>
King, father, royal Dane: O, answer me!<br>
Let me not burst in ignorance; but tell<br>
Why thy canonized bones, hearsed in death,<br>
Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre,<br>
Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd,<br>
Hath oped his ponderous and marble jaws,<br>
To cast thee up again. What may this mean,<br>
That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel<br>
Revisit'st thus the glimpses of the moon,<br>
Making night hideous; and we fools of nature<br>
So horridly to shake our disposition<br>
With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?<br>
Say, why is this? wherefore? what should we do?
Ghost beckons <br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:

<br><br><span class="character HORATIO">HORATIO</span>:
It beckons you to go away with it,<br>
As if it some impartment did desire<br>
To you alone.
<br><br><span class="character MARCELLUS">MARCELLUS</span>:
Look, with what courteous action<br>
It waves you to a more removed ground:<br>
But do not go with it.
<br><br><span class="character HORATIO">HORATIO</span>:
No, by no means.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
It will not speak;<br> then I will follow it.
<br><br><span class="character HORATIO">HORATIO</span>:
Do not, my lord.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Why, what should be the fear?<br>
I do not set my life in a pin's fee;<br>
And for my soul, what can it do to that,<br>
Being a thing immortal as itself?<br>
It waves me forth again: I'll follow it.
<br><br><span class="character HORATIO">HORATIO</span>:
What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,<br>
Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff<br>
That beetles o'er his base into the sea,<br>
And there assume some other horrible form,<br>
Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason<br>
And draw you into madness? think of it:<br>
The very place puts toys of desperation,<br>
Without more motive, into every brain<br>
That looks so many fathoms to the sea<br>
And hears it roar beneath.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
It waves me still.<br>
Go on;<br> I'll follow thee.
<br><br><span class="character MARCELLUS">MARCELLUS</span>:
You shall not go, my lord.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Hold off your hands.
<br><br><span class="character HORATIO">HORATIO</span>:
Be ruled;<br> you shall not go.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
My fate cries out,<br>
And makes each petty artery in this body<br>
As hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve.<br>
Still am I call'd. Unhand me, gentlemen.<br>
By heaven, I'll make a ghost of him that lets me!<br>
I say, away! Go on;<br> I'll follow thee.
<br><span class="actionstyle brackets">Exeunt Ghost and <span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span></span>.<br>

He waxes desperate with imagination.
<br><br><span class="character MARCELLUS">MARCELLUS</span>:
Let's follow;<br> 'tis not fit thus to obey him.
<br><br><span class="character HORATIO">HORATIO</span>:
Have after. To what issue will this come?
<br><br><span class="character MARCELLUS">MARCELLUS</span>:
Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.
<br><br><span class="character HORATIO">HORATIO</span>:
Heaven will direct it.
<br><br><span class="character MARCELLUS">MARCELLUS</span>:
Nay, let's follow him.

SCENE V. Another part of the platform.

<br><span class="actionstyle brackets">Enter GHOST and <span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span></span>
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Where wilt thou lead me? speak; I'll go no further.<br>
Ghost<br>
Mark me.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
I will.<br>
Ghost<br>
My hour is almost come,<br>
When I to sulphurous and tormenting flames<br>
Must render up myself.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Alas, poor ghost!<br>
Ghost<br>
Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing<br>
To what I shall unfold.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Speak;<br> I am bound to hear.<br>
Ghost<br>
So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
What?<br>
Ghost<br>
I am thy father's spirit,<br>
Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night,<br>
And for the day confined to fast in fires,<br>
Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature<br>
Are burnt and purged away. But that I am forbid<br>
To tell the secrets of my prison-house,<br>
I could a tale unfold whose lightest word<br>
Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,<br>
Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres,<br>
Thy knotted and combined locks to part<br>
And each particular hair to stand on end,<br>
Like quills upon the fretful porpentine:<br>
But this eternal blazon must not be<br>
To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list!<br>
If thou didst ever thy dear father love<br>
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
O God!<br>
Ghost<br>
Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Murder!<br>
Ghost<br>
Murder most foul, as in the best it is;<br>
But this most foul, strange and unnatural.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Haste me to know't, that I, with wings as swift<br>
As meditation or the thoughts of love,<br>
May sweep to my revenge.<br>
Ghost<br>
I find thee apt;<br>
And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed<br>
That roots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,<br>
Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear:<br>
'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,<br>
A serpent stung me; so the whole ear of Denmark<br>
Is by a forged process of my death<br>
Rankly abused: but know, thou noble youth,<br>
The serpent that did sting thy father's life<br>
Now wears his crown.<br>
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
O my prophetic soul! My uncle!<br>
Ghost<br>
Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,<br>
With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts,<br>
O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power<br>
So to seduce! won to his shameful lust<br>
The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen:<br>
O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there!<br>
From me, whose love was of that dignity<br>
That it went hand in hand even with the vow<br>
I made to her in marriage, and to decline<br>
Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor<br>
To those of mine!<br>
But virtue, as it never will be moved,<br>
Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,<br>
So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd,<br>
Will sate itself in a celestial bed,<br>
And prey on garbage.<br>
But, soft! methinks I scent the morning air;<br>
Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,<br>
My custom always of the afternoon,<br>
Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,<br>
With juice of cursed hebenon in a vial,<br>
And in the porches of my ears did pour<br>
The leperous distilment; whose effect<br>
Holds such an enmity with blood of man<br>
That swift as quicksilver it courses through<br>
The natural gates and alleys of the body,<br>
And with a sudden vigour doth posset<br>
And curd, like eager droppings into milk,<br>
The thin and wholesome blood: so did it mine;<br>
And a most instant tetter bark'd about,<br>
Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust,<br>
All my smooth body.<br>
Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand<br>
Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd:<br>
Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,<br>
Unhousel'd, disappointed, unanel'd,<br>
No reckoning made, but sent to my account<br>
With all my imperfections on my head:<br>
O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!<br>
If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not;<br>
Let not the royal bed of Denmark be<br>
A couch for luxury and damned incest.<br>
But, howsoever thou pursuest this act,<br>
Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive<br>
Against thy mother aught: leave her to heaven<br>
And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge,<br>
To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once!<br>
The glow-worm shows the matin to be near,<br>
And 'gins to pale his uneffectual fire:<br>
Adieu, adieu! Hamlet, remember me.
<br><span class="actionstyle brackets">Exit.</span>

<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
O all you host of heaven! O earth! what else?<br>
And shall I couple hell? O, fie! Hold, hold, my heart;<br>
And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,<br>
But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee!<br>
Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat<br>
In this distracted globe. Remember thee!<br>
Yea, from the table of my memory<br>
I'll wipe away all trivial fond records,<br>
All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past,<br>
That youth and observation copied there;<br>
And thy commandment all alone shall live<br>
Within the book and volume of my brain,<br>
Unmix'd with baser matter: yes, by heaven!<br>
O most pernicious woman!<br>
O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!<br>
My tables,meet it is I set it down,<br>
That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain;<br>
At least I'm sure it may be so in Denmark:<br>
Writing<br>

So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word;<br>
It is 'Adieu, adieu! remember me.'<br>
I have sworn 't.
<br><br><span class="character MARCELLUS">MARCELLUS</span>,<span class="character HORATIO">HORATIO</span>:

<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
So be it!

[Within] Hillo, ho, ho, my lord!
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Hillo, ho, ho, boy! come, bird, come.
<br><span class="actionstyle brackets">Enter <span class="character HORATIO">HORATIO</span> and <span class="character MARCELLUS">MARCELLUS</span>.</span>

<br><br><span class="character MARCELLUS">MARCELLUS</span>:
How is't, my noble lord?
<br><br><span class="character HORATIO">HORATIO</span>:
What news, my lord?
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
O, wonderful!
<br><br><span class="character HORATIO">HORATIO</span>:
Good my lord, tell it.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
No;<br> you'll reveal it.
<br><br><span class="character HORATIO">HORATIO</span>:
Not I, my lord, by heaven.
<br><br><span class="character MARCELLUS">MARCELLUS</span>:
Nor I, my lord.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
How say you, then; would heart of man once think it?<br>
But you'll be secret?
<br><br><span class="character HORATIO">HORATIO</span>,<span class="character MARCELLUS">MARCELLUS</span>:
Ay, by heaven, my lord.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
There's ne'er a villain dwelling in all Denmark<br>
But he's an arrant knave.
<br><br><span class="character HORATIO">HORATIO</span>:
There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave<br>
To tell us this.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Why, right;<br> you are i' the right;<br>
And so, without more circumstance at all,<br>
I hold it fit that we shake hands and part:<br>
You, as your business and desire shall point you;<br>
For every man has business and desire,<br>
Such as it is; and for mine own poor part,<br>
Look you, I'll go pray.
<br><br><span class="character HORATIO">HORATIO</span>:
These are but wild and whirling words, my lord.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
I'm sorry they offend you, heartily;<br>
Yes, 'faith heartily.
<br><br><span class="character HORATIO">HORATIO</span>:
There's no offence, my lord.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio,<br>
And much offence too. Touching this vision here,<br>
It is an honest ghost, that let me tell you:<br>
For your desire to know what is between us,<br>
O'ermaster 't as you may. And now, good friends,<br>
As you are friends, scholars and soldiers,<br>
Give me one poor request.
<br><br><span class="character HORATIO">HORATIO</span>:
What is't, my lord? we will.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Never make known what you have seen tonight.
<br><br><span class="character HORATIO">HORATIO</span>,<span class="character MARCELLUS">MARCELLUS</span>:
My lord, we will not.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Nay, but swear't.
<br><br><span class="character HORATIO">HORATIO</span>:
In faith,<br>
My lord, not I.
<br><br><span class="character MARCELLUS">MARCELLUS</span>:
Nor I, my lord, in faith.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Upon my sword.
<br><br><span class="character MARCELLUS">MARCELLUS</span>:
We have sworn, my lord, already.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.<br>
Ghost
<span class="actionstyle brackets">[Beneath]</span> Swear.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Ah, ha, boy! say'st thou so? art thou there,<br>
truepenny?<br>
Come on you hear this fellow in the cellarage<br>
Consent to swear.
<br><br><span class="character HORATIO">HORATIO</span>:
Propose the oath, my lord.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Never to speak of this that you have seen,<br>
Swear by my sword.<br>
Ghost
<span class="actionstyle brackets">[Beneath]</span> Swear.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Hic et ubique? then we'll shift our ground.<br>
Come hither, gentlemen,<br>
And lay your hands again upon my sword:<br>
Never to speak of this that you have heard,<br>
Swear by my sword.<br>
Ghost
<span class="actionstyle brackets">[Beneath]</span> Swear.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Well said, old mole! canst work i' the earth so fast?<br>
A worthy pioner! Once more remove, good friends.
<br><br><span class="character HORATIO">HORATIO</span>:
O day and night, but this is wondrous strange!
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.<br>
There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,<br>
Than are dreamt of in your philosophy. But come;<br>
Here, as before, never, so help you mercy,<br>
How strange or odd soe'er I bear myself,<br>
As I perchance hereafter shall think meet<br>
To put an antic disposition on,<br>
That you, at such times seeing me, never shall,<br>
With arms encumber'd thus, or this headshake,<br>
Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,<br>
As 'Well, well, we know,' or 'We could, an if we would,'<br>
Or 'If we list to speak,' or 'There be, an if they might,'<br>
Or such ambiguous giving out, to note<br>
That you know aught of me: this not to do,<br>
So grace and mercy at your most need help you, Swear.<br>

So, gentlemen,<br>
With all my love I do commend me to you:<br>
And what so poor a man as Hamlet is<br>
May do, to express his love and friending to you,<br>
God willing, shall not lack. Let us go in together;<br>
And still your fingers on your lips, I pray.<br>
The time is out of joint: O cursed spite,<br>
That ever I was born to set it right!<br>
Nay, come, let's go together.

ACT II

SCENE I. <br><span class="actionstyle brackets">A room in <span class="character POLONIUS">POLONIUS</span>' house.

Enter <span class="character POLONIUS">POLONIUS</span> and <span class="character REYNALDO">REYNALDO</span></span>.<br>
<br><br><span class="character POLONIUS">LORD POLONIUS</span>:
Give him this money and these notes, Reynaldo.
<br><br><span class="character REYNALDO">REYNALDO</span>:
I will, my lord.
<br><br><span class="character POLONIUS">LORD POLONIUS</span>:
You shall do marvellous wisely, good Reynaldo,
Before you visit him, to make inquire
Of his behavior.
<br><br><span class="character REYNALDO">REYNALDO</span>:
My lord, I did intend it.
<br><br><span class="character POLONIUS">LORD POLONIUS</span>:
Marry, well said; very well said. Look you, sir,<br>
Inquire me first what Danskers are in Paris;<br>
And how, and who, what means, and where they keep,<br>
What company, at what expense; and finding<br>
By this encompassment and drift of question<br>
That they do know my son, come you more nearer<br>
Than your particular demands will touch it:<br>
Take you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him;<br>
As thus, 'I know his father and his friends,<br>
And in part him: ' do you mark this, Reynaldo?
<br><br><span class="character REYNALDO">REYNALDO</span>:
Ay, very well, my lord.
<br><br><span class="character POLONIUS">LORD POLONIUS</span>:
'And in part him; but' you may say 'not well:<br>
But, if't be he I mean, he's very wild;<br>
Addicted so and so:' and there put on him<br>
What forgeries you please; marry, none so rank<br>
As may dishonour him; take heed of that;<br>
But, sir, such wanton, wild and usual slips<br>
As are companions noted and most known<br>
To youth and liberty.
<br><br><span class="character REYNALDO">REYNALDO</span>:
As gaming, my lord.
<br><br><span class="character POLONIUS">LORD POLONIUS</span>:
Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling,<br>
Drabbing: you may go so far.
<br><br><span class="character REYNALDO">REYNALDO</span>:
My lord, that would dishonour him.
<br><br><span class="character POLONIUS">LORD POLONIUS</span>:
'Faith, no;<br> as you may season it in the charge<br>
You must not put another scandal on him,<br>
That he is open to incontinency;<br>
That's not my meaning: but breathe his faults so quaintly<br>
That they may seem the taints of liberty,<br>
The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,<br>
A savageness in unreclaimed blood,<br>
Of general assault.
<br><br><span class="character REYNALDO">REYNALDO</span>:
But, my good lord,
<br><br><span class="character POLONIUS">LORD POLONIUS</span>:
Wherefore should you do this?
<br><br><span class="character REYNALDO">REYNALDO</span>:
Ay, my lord,
I would know that.
<br><br><span class="character POLONIUS">LORD POLONIUS</span>:
Marry, sir, here's my drift;<br>
And I believe, it is a fetch of wit:<br>
You laying these slight sullies on my son,<br>
As 'twere a thing a little soil'd i' the working, Mark you,<br>
Your party in converse, him you would sound,<br>
Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes<br>
The youth you breathe of guilty, be assured<br>
He closes with you in this consequence;<br>
'Good sir,' or so, or 'friend,' or 'gentleman,'<br>
According to the phrase or the addition<br>
Of man and country.
<br><br><span class="character REYNALDO">REYNALDO</span>:
Very good, my lord.
<br><br><span class="character POLONIUS">LORD POLONIUS</span>:
And then, sir, does he this he does what was I<br>
about to say? By the mass, I was about to say<br>
something: where did I leave?
<br><br><span class="character REYNALDO">REYNALDO</span>:
At 'closes in the consequence,' at 'friend or so,'<br>
and 'gentleman.'
<br><br><span class="character POLONIUS">LORD POLONIUS</span>:
At 'closes in the consequence,' ay, marry;<br>
He closes thus: 'I know the gentleman;<br>
I saw him yesterday, or t' other day,<br>
Or then, or then; with such, or such; and, as you say,<br>
There was a' gaming; there o'ertook in's rouse;<br>
There falling out at tennis:' or perchance,<br>
'I saw him enter such a house of sale,'<br>
Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth.<br>
See you now;<br>
Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth:<br>
And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,<br>
With windlasses and with assays of bias,<br>
By indirections find directions out:<br>
So by my former lecture and advice,<br>
Shall you my son. You have me, have you not?
<br><br><span class="character REYNALDO">REYNALDO</span>:
My lord, I have.
<br><br><span class="character POLONIUS">LORD POLONIUS</span>:
God be wi' you;<br> fare you well.
<br><br><span class="character REYNALDO">REYNALDO</span>:
Good my lord!
<br><br><span class="character POLONIUS">LORD POLONIUS</span>:
Observe his inclination in yourself.
<br><br><span class="character REYNALDO">REYNALDO</span>:
I shall, my lord.
<br><br><span class="character POLONIUS">LORD POLONIUS</span>:
And let him ply his music.
<br><br><span class="character REYNALDO">REYNALDO</span>:
Well, my lord.
<br><br><span class="character POLONIUS">LORD POLONIUS</span>:
Farewell!
<br><span class="actionstyle brackets">Exit.</span> <br><br><span class="character REYNALDO">REYNALDO</span>:

<br><span class="actionstyle brackets">Enter <span class="character OPHELIA">OPHELIA</span></span>.<br>

How now, Ophelia! what's the matter?<br>
<br><br><span class="character OPHELIA">OPHELIA</span>:
O, my lord, my lord, I have been so affrighted!<br>
<br><br><span class="character POLONIUS">LORD POLONIUS</span>:
With what, i' the name of God?<br>
<br><br><span class="character OPHELIA">OPHELIA</span>:
My lord, as I was sewing in my closet,<br>
Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbraced;<br>
No hat upon his head; his stockings foul'd,<br>
Ungarter'd, and down-gyved to his ancle;<br>
Pale as his shirt; his knees knocking each other;<br>
And with a look so piteous in purport<br>
As if he had been loosed out of hell<br>
To speak of horrors,he comes before me.<br>
<br><br><span class="character POLONIUS">LORD POLONIUS</span>:
Mad for thy love?
<br><br><span class="character OPHELIA">OPHELIA</span>:
My lord, I do not know;<br>
But truly, I do fear it.
<br><br><span class="character POLONIUS">LORD POLONIUS</span>:
What said he?
<br><br><span class="character OPHELIA">OPHELIA</span>:
He took me by the wrist and held me hard;<br>
Then goes he to the length of all his arm;<br>
And, with his other hand thus o'er his brow,<br>
He falls to such perusal of my face<br>
As he would draw it. Long stay'd he so;<br>
At last, a little shaking of mine arm<br>
And thrice his head thus waving up and down,<br>
He raised a sigh so piteous and profound<br>
As it did seem to shatter all his bulk<br>
And end his being: that done, he lets me go:<br>
And, with his head over his shoulder turn'd,<br>
He seem'd to find his way without his eyes;<br>
For out o' doors he went without their helps,<br>
And, to the last, bended their light on me.
<br><br><span class="character POLONIUS">LORD POLONIUS</span>:
Come, go with me: I will go seek the king.<br>
This is the very ecstasy of love,<br>
Whose violent property fordoes itself<br>
And leads the will to desperate undertakings<br>
As oft as any passion under heaven<br>
That does afflict our natures. I am sorry.<br>
What, have you given him any hard words of late?
<br><br><span class="character OPHELIA">OPHELIA</span>:
No, my good lord, but, as you did command,<br>
I did repel his fetters and denied<br>
His access to me.
<br><br><span class="character POLONIUS">LORD POLONIUS</span>:
That hath made him mad.<br>
I am sorry that with better heed and judgment<br>
I had not quoted him: I fear'd he did but trifle,<br>
And meant to wreck thee; but, beshrew my jealousy!<br>
By heaven, it is as proper to our age<br>
To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions<br>
As it is common for the younger sort<br>
To lack discretion. Come, go we to the king:<br>
This must be known; which, being kept close, might<br>
move
More grief to hide than hate to utter love.
<br><span class="actionstyle brackets">Exeunt</span>.

SCENE II. <br><span class="actionstyle brackets">A room in the castle.

Enter <span class="character KING">KING CLAUDIUS</span>, <span class="character QUEEN">QUEEN GERTRUDE</span>, <span class="character ROS">ROSENCRANTZ</span>, <span class="character GUIL">GUILDENSTERN</span>, and Attendants</span>.
 <br><br><span class="character KING">KING CLAUDIUS</span>:
Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern!<br>
Moreover that we much did long to see you,<br>
The need we have to use you did provoke<br>
Our hasty sending. Something have you heard<br>
Of Hamlet's transformation; so call it,<br>
Sith nor the exterior nor the inward man<br>
Resembles that it was. What it should be,<br>
More than his father's death, that thus hath put him<br>
So much from the understanding of himself,<br>
I cannot dream of: I entreat you both,<br>
That, being of so young days brought up with him,<br>
And sith so neighbour'd to his youth and havior,<br>
That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court<br>
Some little time: so by your companies<br>
To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather,<br>
So much as from occasion you may glean,<br>
Whether aught, to us unknown, afflicts him thus,<br>
That, open'd, lies within our remedy.
<br><br><span class="character QUEEN">QUEEN GERTRUDE</span>:
Good gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you;<br>
And sure I am two men there are not living<br>
To whom he more adheres. If it will please you<br>
To show us so much gentry and good will<br>
As to expend your time with us awhile,<br>
For the supply and profit of our hope,<br>
Your visitation shall receive such thanks<br>
As fits a king's remembrance.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROSENCRANTZ</span>:
Both your majesties<br>
Might, by the sovereign power you have of us,<br>
Put your dread pleasures more into command<br>
Than to entreaty.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUILDENSTERN</span>:
But we both obey,<br>
And here give up ourselves, in the full bent<br>
To lay our service freely at your feet,<br>
To be commanded.
 <br><br><span class="character KING">KING CLAUDIUS</span>:
Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.
<br><br><span class="character QUEEN">QUEEN GERTRUDE</span>:
Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz:<br>
And I beseech you instantly to visit<br>
My too much changed son. Go, some of you,<br>
And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUILDENSTERN</span>:
Heavens make our presence and our practises<br>
Pleasant and helpful to him!
<br><br><span class="character QUEEN">QUEEN GERTRUDE</span>:
Ay, amen!
<br><span class="actionstyle brackets">Exeunt <span class="character ROS">ROSENCRANTZ</span>, <span class="character GUIL">GUILDENSTERN</span>, and some Attendants</span>.

<br><span class="actionstyle brackets">Enter <span class="character POLONIUS">POLONIUS</span></span>.<br>

<br><br><span class="character POLONIUS">LORD POLONIUS</span>:
The ambassadors from Norway, my good lord,<br>
Are joyfully return'd.
 <br><br><span class="character KING">KING CLAUDIUS</span>:
Thou still hast been the father of good news.
<br><br><span class="character POLONIUS">LORD POLONIUS</span>:
Have I, my lord? I assure my good liege,<br>
I hold my duty, as I hold my soul,<br>
Both to my God and to my gracious king:<br>
And I do think, or else this brain of mine<br>
Hunts not the trail of policy so sure<br>
As it hath used to do, that I have found<br>
The very cause of Hamlet's lunacy.
 <br><br><span class="character KING">KING CLAUDIUS</span>:
O, speak of that;<br> that do I long to hear.
<br><br><span class="character POLONIUS">LORD POLONIUS</span>:
Give first admittance to the ambassadors;<br>
My news shall be the fruit to that great feast.
 <br><br><span class="character KING">KING CLAUDIUS</span>:
Thyself do grace to them, and bring them in.
<br><span class="actionstyle brackets">Exit <span class="character POLONIUS">POLONIUS</span></span>.<br>

He tells me, my dear Gertrude, he hath found<br>
The head and source of all your son's distemper.
<br><br><span class="character QUEEN">QUEEN GERTRUDE</span>:
I doubt it is no other but the main;<br>
His father's death, and our o'erhasty marriage.
 <br><br><span class="character KING">KING CLAUDIUS</span>:
Well, we shall sift him.

Welcome, my good friends!<br>
Say, Voltimand, what from our brother Norway?
<br><br><span class="character VOLTIMAND">VOLTIMAND</span>:
Most fair return of greetings and desires.<br>
Upon our first, he sent out to suppress<br>
His nephew's levies; which to him appear'd<br>
To be a preparation 'gainst the Polack;<br>
But, better look'd into, he truly found<br>
It was against your highness: whereat grieved,<br>
That so his sickness, age and impotence<br>
Was falsely borne in hand, sends out arrests<br>
On Fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys;<br>
Receives rebuke from Norway, and in fine<br>
Makes vow before his uncle never more<br>
To give the assay of arms against your majesty.<br>
Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy,<br>
Gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee,<br>
And his commission to employ those soldiers,<br>
So levied as before, against the Polack:<br>
With an entreaty, herein further shown,<br>
Giving a paper<br><br>

That it might please you to give quiet pass<br>
Through your dominions for this enterprise,<br>
On such regards of safety and allowance<br>
As therein are set down.
 <br><br><span class="character KING">KING CLAUDIUS</span>:
It likes us well;<br>
And at our more consider'd time well read,<br>
Answer, and think upon this business.<br>
Meantime we thank you for your well-took labour:<br>
Go to your rest; at night we'll feast together:<br>
Most welcome home!
<br><span class="actionstyle brackets">Exeunt <span class="character VOLTIMAND">VOLTIMAND</span> and <span class="character CORNELIUS">CORNELIUS</span></span>.<br>

<br><br><span class="character POLONIUS">LORD POLONIUS</span>:
This business is well ended.<br>
My liege, and madam, to expostulate<br>
What majesty should be, what duty is,<br>
Why day is day, night night, and time is time,<br>
Were nothing but to waste night, day and time.<br>
Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit,<br>
And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,<br>
I will be brief: your noble son is mad:<br>
Mad call I it; for, to define true madness,<br>
What is't but to be nothing else but mad?<br>
But let that go.
<br><br><span class="character QUEEN">QUEEN GERTRUDE</span>:
More matter, with less art.
<br><br><span class="character POLONIUS">LORD POLONIUS</span>:
Madam, I swear I use no art at all.<br>
That he is mad, 'tis true: 'tis true 'tis pity;<br>
And pity 'tis 'tis true: a foolish figure;<br>
But farewell it, for I will use no art.<br>
Mad let us grant him, then: and now remains<br>
That we find out the cause of this effect,<br>
Or rather say, the cause of this defect,<br>
For this effect defective comes by cause:<br>
Thus it remains, and the remainder thus. Perpend.<br>
I have a daughter have while she is mine<br>
Who, in her duty and obedience, mark,<br>
Hath given me this: now gather, and surmise.<br>
<span class="actionstyle brackets">Reads</span>:

'To the celestial and my soul's idol, the most<br>
beautified Ophelia,'<br>
That's an ill phrase, a vile phrase; 'beautified' is<br>
a vile phrase: but you shall hear. Thus:
<span class="actionstyle brackets">Reads</span>:

'In her excellent white bosom, these, & c.'
<br><br><span class="character QUEEN">QUEEN GERTRUDE</span>:
Came this from Hamlet to her?
<br><br><span class="character POLONIUS">LORD POLONIUS</span>:
Good madam, stay awhile;<br> I will be faithful.
<span class="actionstyle brackets">Reads</span>:

'Doubt thou the stars are fire;<br>
Doubt that the sun doth move;<br>
Doubt truth to be a liar;<br>
But never doubt I love.<br>
'O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers;<br>
I have not art to reckon my groans: but that<br>
I love thee best, O most best, believe it. Adieu.<br>
'Thine evermore most dear lady, whilst
this machine is to him, 
<span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:.'
This, in obedience, hath my daughter shown me,<br>
And more above, hath his solicitings,<br>
As they fell out by time, by means and place,<br>
All given to mine ear.
 <br><br><span class="character KING">KING CLAUDIUS</span>:
But how hath she<br>
Received his love?
<br><br><span class="character POLONIUS">LORD POLONIUS</span>:
What do you think of me?
 <br><br><span class="character KING">KING CLAUDIUS</span>:
As of a man faithful and honourable.
<br><br><span class="character POLONIUS">LORD POLONIUS</span>:
I would fain prove so. But what might you think,<br>
When I had seen this hot love on the wing<br>
As I perceived it, I must tell you that,<br>
Before my daughter told me what might you,<br>
Or my dear majesty your queen here, think,<br>
If I had play'd the desk or table-book,<br>
Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb,<br>
Or look'd upon this love with idle sight;<br>
What might you think? No, I went round to work,<br>
And my young mistress thus I did bespeak:<br>
'Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy star;<br>
This must not be:' and then I precepts gave her,<br>
That she should lock herself from his resort,<br>
Admit no messengers, receive no tokens.<br>
Which done, she took the fruits of my advice;<br>
And he, repulsed a short tale to make <br>
Fell into a sadness, then into a fast,<br>
Thence to a watch, thence into a weakness,<br>
Thence to a lightness, and, by this declension,<br>
Into the madness wherein now he raves,<br>
And all we mourn for.
 <br><br><span class="character KING">KING CLAUDIUS</span>:
Do you think 'tis this?
<br><br><span class="character QUEEN">QUEEN GERTRUDE</span>:
It may be, very likely.
<br><br><span class="character POLONIUS">LORD POLONIUS</span>:
Hath there been such a time I'd fain know that<br>
That I have positively said 'Tis so,'<br>
When it proved otherwise?
 <br><br><span class="character KING">KING CLAUDIUS</span>:
Not that I know.
<br><br><span class="character POLONIUS">LORD POLONIUS</span>:
[Pointing to his head and shoulder]<br>
Take this from this, if this be otherwise:<br>
If circumstances lead me, I will find<br>
Where truth is hid, though it were hid indeed<br>
Within the centre.
 <br><br><span class="character KING">KING CLAUDIUS</span>:
How may we try it further?
<br><br><span class="character POLONIUS">LORD POLONIUS</span>:
You know, sometimes he walks four hours together<br>
Here in the lobby.
<br><br><span class="character QUEEN">QUEEN GERTRUDE</span>:
So he does indeed.
<br><br><span class="character POLONIUS">LORD POLONIUS</span>:
At such a time I'll loose my daughter to him:<br>
Be you and I behind an arras then;<br>
Mark the encounter: if he love her not<br>
And be not from his reason fall'n thereon,<br>
Let me be no assistant for a state,<br>
But keep a farm and carters.
 <br><br><span class="character KING">KING CLAUDIUS</span>:
We will try it.
<br><br><span class="character QUEEN">QUEEN GERTRUDE</span>:
But, look, where sadly the poor wretch comes reading.
<br><br><span class="character POLONIUS">LORD POLONIUS</span>:
Away, I do beseech you, both away:<br>
I'll board him presently.
<br><span class="actionstyle brackets">Exeunt  <br><br><span class="character KING">KING CLAUDIUS</span>, <span class="character QUEEN">QUEEN GERTRUDE</span>, and Attendants</span>.

<br><span class="actionstyle brackets">Enter <span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>, reading</span>.

O, give me leave:<br>
How does my good Lord Hamlet?
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Well, God-a-mercy.
<br><br><span class="character POLONIUS">LORD POLONIUS</span>:
Do you know me, my lord?
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Excellent well;<br> you are a fishmonger.
<br><br><span class="character POLONIUS">LORD POLONIUS</span>:
Not I, my lord.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Then I would you were so honest a man.
<br><br><span class="character POLONIUS">LORD POLONIUS</span>:
Honest, my lord!
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Ay, sir;<br> to be honest, as this world goes, is to be
one man picked out of ten thousand.
<br><br><span class="character POLONIUS">LORD POLONIUS</span>:
That's very true, my lord.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a<br>
god kissing carrion, <br>Have you a daughter?
<br><br><span class="character POLONIUS">LORD POLONIUS</span>:
I have, my lord.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Let her not walk i' the sun: conception is a
blessing: but not as your daughter may conceive.<br>
Friend, look to 't.
<br><br><span class="character POLONIUS">LORD POLONIUS</span>:
<span class="actionstyle brackets">[Aside]</span> How say you by that?<br> Still harping on my
daughter: yet he knew me not at first;<br> he said I
was a fishmonger: he is far gone, far gone: and
truly in my youth I suffered much extremity for
love; very near this. I'll speak to him again.
What do you read, my lord?
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Words, words, words.
<br><br><span class="character POLONIUS">LORD POLONIUS</span>:
What is the matter, my lord?
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Between who?
<br><br><span class="character POLONIUS">LORD POLONIUS</span>:
I mean, the matter that you read, my lord.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Slanders, sir: for the satirical rogue says here
that old men have grey beards, that their faces are
wrinkled, their eyes purging thick amber and
plum-tree gum and that they have a plentiful lack of
wit, together with most weak hams: all which, sir,
though I most powerfully and potently believe, yet
I hold it not honesty to have it thus set down, for
yourself, sir, should be old as I am, if like a crab
you could go backward.
<br><br><span class="character POLONIUS">LORD POLONIUS</span>:
<span class="actionstyle brackets">[Aside]</span> Though this be madness, yet there is method
in 't. Will you walk out of the air, my lord?
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Into my grave.
<br><br><span class="character POLONIUS">LORD POLONIUS</span>:
Indeed, that is out o' the air.
<span class="actionstyle brackets">[Aside]</span>

How pregnant sometimes his replies are! a happiness
that often madness hits on, which reason and sanity
could not so prosperously be delivered of. I will
leave him, and suddenly contrive the means of
meeting between him and my daughter. My honourable
lord, I will most humbly take my leave of you.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
You cannot, sir, take from me any thing that I will
more willingly part withal: except my life, except
my life, except my life.
<br><br><span class="character POLONIUS">LORD POLONIUS</span>:
Fare you well, my lord.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
These tedious old fools!
<br><span class="actionstyle brackets">Enter <span class="character ROS">ROSENCRANTZ</span> and <span class="character GUIL">GUILDENSTERN</span></span>

<br><br><span class="character POLONIUS">LORD POLONIUS</span>:
You go to seek the Lord Hamlet;<br> there he is.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROSENCRANTZ</span>:
[To <span class="character POLONIUS">POLONIUS</span>:] God save you, sir!
<br><span class="actionstyle brackets">Exit.</span> <br><br><span class="character POLONIUS">POLONIUS</span>:

<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUILDENSTERN</span>:
My honoured lord!
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROSENCRANTZ</span>:
My most dear lord!
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
My excellent good friends! How dost thou,<br>
Guildenstern? Ah, Rosencrantz! Good lads, how do ye both?
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROSENCRANTZ</span>:
As the indifferent children of the earth.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUILDENSTERN</span>:
Happy, in that we are not over-happy;<br>
On fortune's cap we are not the very button.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Nor the soles of her shoe?
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROSENCRANTZ</span>:
Neither, my lord.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Then you live about her waist, or in the middle of
her favours?
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUILDENSTERN</span>:
'Faith, her privates we.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
In the secret parts of fortune? O, most true;<br> she
is a strumpet. What's the news?
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROSENCRANTZ</span>:
None, my lord, but that the world's grown honest.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Then is doomsday near: but your news is not true.<br>
Let me question more in particular: what have you,
my good friends, deserved at the hands of fortune,
that she sends you to prison hither?
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUILDENSTERN</span>:
Prison, my lord!
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Denmark's a prison.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROSENCRANTZ</span>:
Then is the world one.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
A goodly one;<br> in which there are many confines,
wards and dungeons, Denmark being one o' the worst.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROSENCRANTZ</span>:
We think not so, my lord.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Why, then, 'tis none to you;<br> for there is nothing
either good or bad, but thinking makes it so: to me
it is a prison.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROSENCRANTZ</span>:
Why then, your ambition makes it one;<br> 'tis too
narrow for your mind.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
O God, I could be bounded in a nut shell and count
myself a king of infinite space, were it not that I
have bad dreams.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUILDENSTERN</span>:
Which dreams indeed are ambition, for the very
substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
A dream itself is but a shadow.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROSENCRANTZ</span>:
Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a
quality that it is but a shadow's shadow.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and
outstretched heroes the beggars' shadows. Shall we
to the court? for, by my fay, I cannot reason.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROSENCRANTZ</span>,<span class="character GUIL">GUILDENSTERN</span>:
We'll wait upon you.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
No such matter: I will not sort you with the rest
of my servants, for, to speak to you like an honest
man, I am most dreadfully attended. But, in the
beaten way of friendship, what make you at Elsinore?
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROSENCRANTZ</span>:
To visit you, my lord;<br> no other occasion.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks;<br> but I
thank you: and sure, dear friends, my thanks are
too dear a halfpenny. Were you not sent for? Is it
your own inclining? Is it a free visitation? Come,
deal justly with me: come, come;<br> nay, speak.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUILDENSTERN</span>:
What should we say, my lord?
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Why, any thing, but to the purpose. You were sent
for; and there is a kind of confession in your looks
which your modesties have not craft enough to colour:
I know the good king and queen have sent for you.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROSENCRANTZ</span>:
To what end, my lord?
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
That you must teach me. But let me conjure you, by
the rights of our fellowship, by the consonancy of
our youth, by the obligation of our ever-preserved
love, and by what more dear a better proposer could
charge you withal, be even and direct with me,
whether you were sent for, or no?
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROSENCRANTZ</span>:
[Aside to <br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUILDENSTERN</span>:] What say you?
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
<span class="actionstyle brackets">[Aside]</span> Nay, then, I have an eye of you.--If you
love me, hold not off.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUILDENSTERN</span>:
My lord, we were sent for.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
I will tell you why;<br> so shall my anticipation
prevent your discovery, and your secrecy to the king
and queen moult no feather. I have of late--but
wherefore I know not--lost all my mirth, forgone all
custom of exercises;<br> and indeed it goes so heavily
with my disposition that this goodly frame, the
earth, seems to me a sterile promontory, this most
excellent canopy, the air, look you, this brave
o'erhanging firmament, this majestical roof fretted
with golden fire, why, it appears no other thing to
me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours.
What a piece of work is a man! how noble in reason!
how infinite in faculty! in form and moving how
express and admirable! in action how like an angel!
in apprehension how like a god! the beauty of the
world! the paragon of animals! And yet, to me,
what is this quintessence of dust? man delights not
me: no, nor woman neither, though by your smiling
you seem to say so.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROSENCRANTZ</span>:
My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Why did you laugh then, when I said 'man delights not me'?
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROSENCRANTZ</span>:
To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what
lenten entertainment the players shall receive from
you: we coted them on the way;<br> and hither are they
coming, to offer you service.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
He that plays the king shall be welcome;<br> his majesty
shall have tribute of me;<br> the adventurous knight
shall use his foil and target;<br> the lover shall not
sigh gratis;<br> the humourous man shall end his part
in peace;<br> the clown shall make those laugh whose
lungs are tickled o' the sere;<br> and the lady shall
say her mind freely, or the blank verse shall halt
for't. What players are they?
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROSENCRANTZ</span>:
Even those you were wont to take delight in, the
tragedians of the city.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
How chances it they travel? their residence, both
in reputation and profit, was better both ways.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROSENCRANTZ</span>:
I think their inhibition comes by the means of the
late innovation.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was
in the city? are they so followed?
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROSENCRANTZ</span>:
No, indeed, are they not.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
How comes it? do they grow rusty?
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROSENCRANTZ</span>:
Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace: but
there is, sir, an aery of children, little eyases,
that cry out on the top of question, and are most
tyrannically clapped for't: these are now the
fashion, and so berattle the common stages so they
call them that many wearing rapiers are afraid of
goose-quills and dare scarce come thither.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
What, are they children? who maintains 'em? how are
they escoted? Will they pursue the quality no
longer than they can sing? will they not say
afterwards, if they should grow themselves to common
players as it is most like, if their means are no
better their writers do them wrong, to make them
exclaim against their own succession?
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROSENCRANTZ</span>:
'Faith, there has been much to do on both sides;<br> and
the nation holds it no sin to tarre them to
controversy: there was, for a while, no money bid
for argument, unless the poet and the player went to
cuffs in the question.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Is't possible?
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUILDENSTERN</span>:
O, there has been much throwing about of brains.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Do the boys carry it away?
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROSENCRANTZ</span>:
Ay, that they do, my lord;<br> Hercules and his load too.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
It is not very strange; for mine uncle is king of
Denmark, and those that would make mows at him while
my father lived, give twenty, forty, fifty, an
hundred ducats a-piece for his picture in little.
'Sblood, there is something in this more than
natural, if philosophy could find it out.<br>
Flourish of trumpets within

<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUILDENSTERN</span>:
There are the players.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands,
come then: the appurtenance of welcome is fashion
and ceremony: let me comply with you in this garb,
lest my extent to the players, which, I tell you,
must show fairly outward, should more appear like
entertainment than yours. You are welcome: but my
uncle-father and aunt-mother are deceived.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUILDENSTERN</span>:
In what, my dear lord?
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
I am but mad north-north-west: when the wind is
southerly I know a hawk from a handsaw.
Enter <span class="character POLONIUS">POLONIUS</span>:

<br><br><span class="character POLONIUS">LORD POLONIUS</span>:
Well be with you, gentlemen!
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Hark you, Guildenstern;<br> and you too: at each ear a
hearer: that great baby you see there is not yet
out of his swaddling-clouts.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROSENCRANTZ</span>:
Happily he's the second time come to them;<br> for they
say an old man is twice a child.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players;<br>
mark it. You say right, sir: o' Monday morning;<br>
'twas so indeed.
<br><br><span class="character POLONIUS">LORD POLONIUS</span>:
My lord, I have news to tell you.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
My lord, I have news to tell you.
When Roscius was an actor in Rome,--
<br><br><span class="character POLONIUS">LORD POLONIUS</span>:
The actors are come hither, my lord.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Buz, buz!
<br><br><span class="character POLONIUS">LORD POLONIUS</span>:
Upon mine honour,--
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Then came each actor on his ass,--
<br><br><span class="character POLONIUS">LORD POLONIUS</span>:
The best actors in the world, either for tragedy,
comedy, history, pastoral, pastoral-comical,
historical-pastoral, tragical-historical, tragical-
comical-historical-pastoral, scene individable, or
poem unlimited: Seneca cannot be too heavy, nor
Plautus too light. For the law of writ and the
liberty, these are the only men.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou!
<br><br><span class="character POLONIUS">LORD POLONIUS</span>:
What a treasure had he, my lord?
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Why,
'One fair daughter and no more,
The which he loved passing well.'
<br><br><span class="character POLONIUS">LORD POLONIUS</span>:
<span class="actionstyle brackets">[Aside]</span> Still on my daughter.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Am I not i' the right, old Jephthah?
<br><br><span class="character POLONIUS">LORD POLONIUS</span>:
If you call me Jephthah, my lord, I have a daughter
that I love passing well.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Nay, that follows not.
<br><br><span class="character POLONIUS">LORD POLONIUS</span>:
What follows, then, my lord?
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Why,
'As by lot, God wot,'
and then, you know,
'It came to pass, as most like it was,'
the first row of the pious chanson will show you
more;<br> for look, where my abridgement comes.
Enter four or five <br><br><span class="character PLAYERS">PLAYERS</span>:

You are welcome, masters;<br> welcome, all. I am glad
to see thee well. Welcome, good friends. O, my old
friend! thy face is valenced since I saw thee last:
comest thou to beard me in Denmark? What, my young
lady and mistress! By'r lady, your ladyship is
nearer to heaven than when I saw you last, by the
altitude of a chopine. Pray God, your voice, like
apiece of uncurrent gold, be not cracked within the
ring. Masters, you are all welcome. We'll e'en
to't like French falconers, fly at any thing we see:
we'll have a speech straight: come, give us a taste
of your quality;<br> come, a passionate speech.
<br><br><span class="character PLAYER">First Player</span>:
What speech, my lord?
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was
never acted;<br> or, if it was, not above once;<br> for the
play, I remember, pleased not the million;<br> 'twas
caviare to the general: but it was as I received
it, and others, whose judgments in such matters
cried in the top of mine an excellent play, well
digested in the scenes, set down with as much
modesty as cunning. I remember, one said there
were no sallets in the lines to make the matter
savoury, nor no matter in the phrase that might
indict the author of affectation;<br> but called it an
honest method, as wholesome as sweet, and by very
much more handsome than fine. One speech in it I
chiefly loved: 'twas Aeneas' tale to Dido;<br> and
thereabout of it especially, where he speaks of
Priam's slaughter: if it live in your memory, begin
at this line: let me see, let me see <br>
'The rugged Pyrrhus, like the Hyrcanian beast,'
it is not so: it begins with Pyrrhus: 
'The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms,<br>
Black as his purpose, did the night resemble<br>
When he lay couched in the ominous horse,<br>
Hath now this dread and black complexion smear'd<br>
With heraldry more dismal; head to foot<br>
Now is he total gules; horridly trick'd<br>
With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,<br>
Baked and impasted with the parching streets,<br>
That lend a tyrannous and damned light<br>
To their lord's murder: roasted in wrath and fire,<br>
And thus o'er-sized with coagulate gore,<br>
With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus<br>
Old grandsire Priam seeks.'<br>
So, proceed you.
<br><br><span class="character POLONIUS">LORD POLONIUS</span>:
'Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and
good discretion.
<br><br><span class="character PLAYER">First Player</span>:
'Anon he finds him
Striking too short at Greeks; his antique sword,<br>
Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,<br>
Repugnant to command: unequal match'd,<br>
Pyrrhus at Priam drives; in rage strikes wide;<br>
But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword<br>
The unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,<br>
Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top<br>
Stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash<br>
Takes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear: for, lo! his sword,<br>
Which was declining on the milky head<br>
Of reverend Priam, seem'd i' the air to stick:<br>
So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood,<br>
And like a neutral to his will and matter,<br>
Did nothing.<br>
But, as we often see, against some storm,<br>
A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,<br>
The bold winds speechless and the orb below<br>
As hush as death, anon the dreadful thunder<br>
Doth rend the region, so, after Pyrrhus' pause,<br>
Aroused vengeance sets him new a-work;<br>
And never did the Cyclops' hammers fall<br>
On Mars's armour forged for proof eterne<br>
With less remorse than Pyrrhus' bleeding sword<br>
Now falls on Priam.<br>
Out, out, thou strumpet, Fortune! All you gods,<br>
In general synod 'take away her power;<br>
Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel,<br>
And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven,<br>
As low as to the fiends!'

'But who, O, who had seen the mobled queen'
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
'The mobled queen?'
<br><br><span class="character POLONIUS">LORD POLONIUS</span>:
That's good;<br> 'mobled queen' is good.
<br><br><span class="character PLAYER">First Player</span>:
'Run barefoot up and down, threatening the flames<br>
With bisson rheum; a clout upon that head<br>
Where late the diadem stood, and for a robe,<br>
About her lank and all o'er-teemed loins,<br>
A blanket, in the alarm of fear caught up;<br>
Who this had seen, with tongue in venom steep'd,<br>
'Gainst Fortune's state would treason have
pronounced:<br>
But if the gods themselves did see her then<br>
When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport<br>
In mincing with his sword her husband's limbs,<br>
The instant burst of clamour that she made,<br>
Unless things mortal move them not at all,<br>
Would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven,<br>
And passion in the gods.'

tears in's eyes. Pray you, no more.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
'Tis well: I'll have thee speak out the rest soon.<br>
Good my lord, will you see the players well<br>
bestowed? Do you hear, let them be well used; for<br>
they are the abstract and brief chronicles of the<br>
time: after your death you were better have a bad<br>
epitaph than their ill report while you live.
<br><br><span class="character POLONIUS">LORD POLONIUS</span>:
My lord, I will use them according to their desert.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
God's bodykins, man, much better: use every man<br>
after his desert, and who should 'scape whipping?<br>
Use them after your own honour and dignity: the less<br>
they deserve, the more merit is in your bounty.<br>
Take them in.
<br><br><span class="character POLONIUS">LORD POLONIUS</span>:
Come, sirs.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:

Murder of Gonzago?
<br><br><span class="character PLAYER">First Player</span>:
Ay, my lord.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
We'll ha't to-morrow night. You could, for a need,<br>
study a speech of some dozen or sixteen lines, which<br>
I would set down and insert in't, could you not?
<br><br><span class="character PLAYER">First Player</span>:
Ay, my lord.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Very well. Follow that lord; and look you mock him
not.
<br><span class="actionstyle brackets">Exit.</span> <br><br><span class="character PLAYER">First Player</span>:

My good friends, I'll leave you till night: you are
welcome to Elsinore.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROSENCRANTZ</span>:
Good my lord!
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Ay, so, God be wi' ye;<br>
Exeunt <span class="character ROS">ROSENCRANTZ</span> and <span class="character GUIL">GUILDENSTERN</span>:

Now I am alone.<br>
O, what a rogue and peasant slave am I!<br>
Is it not monstrous that this player here,<br>
But in a fiction, in a dream of passion,<br>
Could force his soul so to his own conceit<br>
That from her working all his visage wann'd,<br>
Tears in his eyes, distraction in's aspect,<br>
A broken voice, and his whole function suiting<br>
With forms to his conceit? and all for nothing!<br>
For Hecuba!<br>
What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,<br>
That he should weep for her? What would he do,<br>
Had he the motive and the cue for passion<br>
That I have? He would drown the stage with tears<br>
And cleave the general ear with horrid speech,<br>
Make mad the guilty and appal the free,<br>
Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed<br>
The very faculties of eyes and ears. Yet I,<br>
A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak,<br>
Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,<br>
And can say nothing; no, not for a king,<br>
Upon whose property and most dear life<br>
A damn'd defeat was made. Am I a coward?<br>
Who calls me villain? breaks my pate across?<br>
Plucks off my beard, and blows it in my face?<br>
Tweaks me by the nose? gives me the lie i' the throat,<br>
As deep as to the lungs? who does me this?<br>
Ha!<br>
'Swounds, I should take it: for it cannot be<br>
But I am pigeon-liver'd and lack gall<br>
To make oppression bitter, or ere this<br>
I should have fatted all the region kites<br>
With this slave's offal: bloody, bawdy villain!<br>
Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!<br>
O, vengeance!<br>
Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave,<br>
That I, the son of a dear father murder'd,<br>
Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,<br>
Must, like a whore, unpack my heart with words,<br>
And fall a-cursing, like a very drab,<br>
A scullion!<br>
Fie upon't! foh! About, my brain! I have heard<br>
That guilty creatures sitting at a play<br>
Have by the very cunning of the scene<br>
Been struck so to the soul that presently<br>
They have proclaim'd their malefactions;<br>
For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak<br>
With most miraculous organ. I'll have these players<br>
Play something like the murder of my father<br>
Before mine uncle: I'll observe his looks;<br>
I'll tent him to the quick: if he but blench,<br>
I know my course. The spirit that I have seen<br>
May be the devil: and the devil hath power<br>
To assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps<br>
Out of my weakness and my melancholy,<br>
As he is very potent with such spirits,<br>
Abuses me to damn me: I'll have grounds<br>
More relative than this: the play 's the thing<br>
Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the king.

ACT III

SCENE I. A room in the castle.
<span class = "ham_anchor" id="ham_anchor3"></span>
Enter <span class="character KING">KING CLAUDIUS</span>, <span class="character QUEEN">QUEEN GERTRUDE</span>, <span class="character POLONIUS">POLONIUS</span>, <span class="character OPHELIA">OPHELIA</span>, <span class="character ROS">ROSENCRANTZ</span>, and <span class="character GUIL">GUILDENSTERN</span>:
 <br><br><span class="character KING">KING CLAUDIUS</span>:
And can you, by no drift of circumstance,<br>
Get from him why he puts on this confusion,<br>
Grating so harshly all his days of quiet<br>
With turbulent and dangerous lunacy?
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROSENCRANTZ</span>:
He does confess he feels himself distracted;<br>
But from what cause he will by no means speak.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUILDENSTERN</span>:
Nor do we find him forward to be sounded,<br>
But, with a crafty madness, keeps aloof,<br>
When we would bring him on to some confession<br>
Of his true state.
<br><br><span class="character QUEEN">QUEEN GERTRUDE</span>:
Did he receive you well?
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROSENCRANTZ</span>:
Most like a gentleman.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUILDENSTERN</span>:
But with much forcing of his disposition.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROSENCRANTZ</span>:
Niggard of question; but, of our demands,<br>
Most free in his reply.
<br><br><span class="character QUEEN">QUEEN GERTRUDE</span>:
Did you assay him?<br>
To any pastime?
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROSENCRANTZ</span>:
Madam, it so fell out, that certain players<br>
We o'er-raught on the way: of these we told him;<br>
And there did seem in him a kind of joy<br>
To hear of it: they are about the court,<br>
And, as I think, they have already order<br>
This night to play before him.
<br><br><span class="character POLONIUS">LORD POLONIUS</span>:
'Tis most true:<br>
And he beseech'd me to entreat your majesties<br>
To hear and see the matter.
 <br><br><span class="character KING">KING CLAUDIUS</span>:
With all my heart; and it doth much content me<br>
To hear him so inclined.<br>
Good gentlemen, give him a further edge,<br>
And drive his purpose on to these delights.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROSENCRANTZ</span>:
We shall, my lord.
Exeunt <span class="character ROS">ROSENCRANTZ</span> and <span class="character GUIL">GUILDENSTERN</span>:

 <br><br><span class="character KING">KING CLAUDIUS</span>:
Sweet Gertrude, leave us too;<br>
For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither,<br>
That he, as 'twere by accident, may here<br>
Affront Ophelia:<br>
Her father and myself, lawful espials,<br>
Will so bestow ourselves that, seeing, unseen,<br>
We may of their encounter frankly judge,<br>
And gather by him, as he is behaved,<br>
If 't be the affliction of his love or no<br>
That thus he suffers for.
<br><br><span class="character QUEEN">QUEEN GERTRUDE</span>:
I shall obey you.<br>
And for your part, Ophelia, I do wish<br>
That your good beauties be the happy cause<br>
Of Hamlet's wildness: so shall I hope your virtues<br>
Will bring him to his wonted way again,<br>
To both your honours.
<br><br><span class="character OPHELIA">OPHELIA</span>:
Madam, I wish it may.
<br><span class="actionstyle brackets">Exit.</span> <br><br><span class="character QUEEN">QUEEN GERTRUDE</span>:

<br><br><span class="character POLONIUS">LORD POLONIUS</span>:
Ophelia, walk you here. Gracious, so please you,<br>
We will bestow ourselves.
To <span class="character OPHELIA">OPHELIA</span>:

Read on this book;<br>
That show of such an exercise may colour<br>
Your loneliness. We are oft to blame in this,<br>
'Tis too much proved--that with devotion's visage<br>
And pious action we do sugar o'er<br>
The devil himself.
 <br><br><span class="character KING">KING CLAUDIUS</span>:
<span class="actionstyle brackets">[Aside]</span> O, 'tis too true!
How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience!<br>
The harlot's cheek, beautied with plastering art,<br>
Is not more ugly to the thing that helps it<br>
Than is my deed to my most painted word:<br>
O heavy burthen!
<br><br><span class="character POLONIUS">LORD POLONIUS</span>:
I hear him coming: let's withdraw, my lord.
Exeunt  <br><br><span class="character KING">KING CLAUDIUS</span> and <span class="character POLONIUS">POLONIUS</span>:

Enter <span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:

<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
To be, or not to be: that is the question:<br>
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer<br>
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,<br>
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,<br>
And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep;<br>
No more; and by a sleep to say we end<br>
The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks<br>
That flesh is heir to, 'tis a consummation<br>
Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep;<br>
To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub;<br>
For in that sleep of death what dreams may come<br>
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,<br>
Must give us pause: there's the respect<br>
That makes calamity of so long life;<br>
For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,<br>
The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,<br>
The pangs of despised love, the law's delay,<br>
The insolence of office and the spurns<br>
That patient merit of the unworthy takes,<br>
When he himself might his quietus make<br>
With a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear,<br>
To grunt and sweat under a weary life,<br>
But that the dread of something after death,<br>
The undiscover'd country from whose bourn<br>
No traveller returns, puzzles the will<br>
And makes us rather bear those ills we have<br>
Than fly to others that we know not of?<br>
Thus conscience does make cowards of us all;<br>
And thus the native hue of resolution<br>
Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,<br>
And enterprises of great pith and moment<br>
With this regard their currents turn awry,<br>
And lose the name of action.<br>Soft you now!<br>
The fair Ophelia! Nymph, in thy orisons<br>
Be all my sins remember'd.
<br><br><span class="character OPHELIA">OPHELIA</span>:
Good my lord,<br>
How does your honour for this many a day?
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
I humbly thank you;<br> well, well, well.
<br><br><span class="character OPHELIA">OPHELIA</span>:
My lord, I have remembrances of yours,<br>
That I have longed long to re-deliver;<br>
I pray you, now receive them.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
No, not I;<br>
I never gave you aught.
<br><br><span class="character OPHELIA">OPHELIA</span>:
My honour'd lord, you know right well you did;<br>
And, with them, words of so sweet breath composed<br>
As made the things more rich: their perfume lost,<br>
Take these again; for to the noble mind<br>
Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.<br>
There, my lord.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Ha, ha! are you honest?
<br><br><span class="character OPHELIA">OPHELIA</span>:
My lord?
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Are you fair?
<br><br><span class="character OPHELIA">OPHELIA</span>:
What means your lordship?
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
That if you be honest and fair, your honesty should<br>
admit no discourse to your beauty.
<br><br><span class="character OPHELIA">OPHELIA</span>:
Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce than<br>
with honesty?
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Ay, truly;<br> for the power of beauty will sooner<br>
transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty can translate beauty into his
likeness: this was sometime a paradox, but now the
time gives it proof. I did love you once.
<br><br><span class="character OPHELIA">OPHELIA</span>:
Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
You should not have believed me;<br> for virtue cannot
so inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of
it: I loved you not.
<br><br><span class="character OPHELIA">OPHELIA</span>:
I was the more deceived.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Get thee to a nunnery: why wouldst thou be a
breeder of sinners? I am myself indifferent honest;<br>
but yet I could accuse me of such things that it
were better my mother had not borne me: I am very
proud, revengeful, ambitious, with more offences at
my beck than I have thoughts to put them in,
imagination to give them shape, or time to act them
in. What should such fellows as I do crawling
between earth and heaven? We are arrant knaves,
all;<br> believe none of us. Go thy ways to a nunnery.
Where's your father?
<br><br><span class="character OPHELIA">OPHELIA</span>:
At home, my lord.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the
fool no where but in's own house. Farewell.
<br><br><span class="character OPHELIA">OPHELIA</span>:
O, help him, you sweet heavens!
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
If thou dost marry, I'll give thee this plague for
thy dowry: be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as
snow, thou shalt not escape calumny. Get thee to a
nunnery, go: farewell. Or, if thou wilt needs
marry, marry a fool;<br> for wise men know well enough
what monsters you make of them. To a nunnery, go,
and quickly too. Farewell.
<br><br><span class="character OPHELIA">OPHELIA</span>:
O heavenly powers, restore him!
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
I have heard of your paintings too, well enough;<br> God
has given you one face, and you make yourselves
another: you jig, you amble, and you lisp, and
nick-name God's creatures, and make your wantonness
your ignorance. Go to, I'll no more on't;<br> it hath
made me mad. I say, we will have no more marriages:
those that are married already, all but one, shall
live;<br> the rest shall keep as they are. To a
nunnery, go.
<br><span class="actionstyle brackets">Exit.</span>

<br><br><span class="character OPHELIA">OPHELIA</span>:
O, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown!<br>
The courtier's, soldier's, scholar's, eye, tongue, sword;<br>
The expectancy and rose of the fair state,<br>
The glass of fashion and the mould of form,<br>
The observed of all observers, quite, quite down!<br>
And I, of ladies most deject and wretched,<br>
That suck'd the honey of his music vows,<br>
Now see that noble and most sovereign reason,<br>
Like sweet bells jangled, out of tune and harsh;<br>
That unmatch'd form and feature of blown youth<br>
Blasted with ecstasy: O, woe is me,<br>

 <br><br><span class="character KING">KING CLAUDIUS</span>:
Love! his affections do not that way tend;<br>
Nor what he spake, though it lack'd form a little,<br>
Was not like madness. There's something in his soul,<br>
O'er which his melancholy sits on brood;<br>
And I do doubt the hatch and the disclose<br>
Will be some danger: which for to prevent,<br>
I have in quick determination<br>
Thus set it down: he shall with speed to England,<br>
For the demand of our neglected tribute<br>
Haply the seas and countries different<br>
With variable objects shall expel<br>
This something-settled matter in his heart,<br>
Whereon his brains still beating puts him thus<br>
From fashion of himself. What think you on't?
<br><br><span class="character POLONIUS">LORD POLONIUS</span>:
It shall do well: but yet do I believe<br>
The origin and commencement of his grief<br>
Sprung from neglected love. How now, Ophelia!<br>
You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said;<br>
We heard it all. My lord, do as you please;<br>
But, if you hold it fit, after the play<br>
Let his queen mother all alone entreat him<br>
To show his grief: let her be round with him;<br>
And I'll be placed, so please you, in the ear<br>
Of all their conference. If she find him not,<br>
To England send him, or confine him where<br>
Your wisdom best shall think.
 <br><br><span class="character KING">KING CLAUDIUS</span>:
It shall be so:<br>
Madness in great ones must not unwatch'd go.

SCENE II. A hall in the castle.

<br><span class="actionstyle brackets">Enter <span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span> and <span class="character PLAYERS">PLAYERS</span></span>.<br>
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to
you, trippingly on the tongue: but if you mouth it,
as many of your players do, I had as lief the
town-crier spoke my lines. Nor do not saw the air
too much with your hand, thus, but use all gently;<br>
for in the very torrent, tempest, and, as I may say,
the whirlwind of passion, you must acquire and beget
a temperance that may give it smoothness. O, it
offends me to the soul to hear a robustious
periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to tatters, to
very rags, to split the ears of the groundlings, who
for the most part are capable of nothing but
inexplicable dumbshows and noise: I would have such
a fellow whipped for o'erdoing Termagant;<br> it
out-herods Herod: pray you, avoid it.
<br><br><span class="character PLAYER">First Player</span>:
I warrant your honour.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Be not too tame neither, but let your own discretion
be your tutor: suit the action to the word, the
word to the action;<br> with this special o'erstep not
the modesty of nature: for any thing so overdone is
from the purpose of playing, whose end, both at the
first and now, was and is, to hold, as 'twere, the
mirror up to nature;<br> to show virtue her own feature,
scorn her own image, and the very age and body of
the time his form and pressure. Now this overdone,
or come tardy off, though it make the unskilful
laugh, cannot but make the judicious grieve;<br> the
censure of the which one must in your allowance
o'erweigh a whole theatre of others. O, there be
players that I have seen play, and heard others
praise, and that highly, not to speak it profanely,
that, neither having the accent of Christians nor
the gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have so
strutted and bellowed that I have thought some of
nature's journeymen had made men and not made them
well, they imitated humanity so abominably.
<br><br><span class="character PLAYER">First Player</span>:
I hope we have reformed that indifferently with us,
sir.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
O, reform it altogether. And let those that play
your clowns speak no more than is set down for them;<br>
for there be of them that will themselves laugh, to
set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh
too;<br> though, in the mean time, some necessary
question of the play be then to be considered:
that's villanous, and shows a most pitiful ambition
in the fool that uses it. Go, make you ready.

Nay, do not think I flatter;<br>
For what advancement may I hope from thee<br>
That no revenue hast but thy good spirits,<br>
To feed and clothe thee? Why should the poor be flatter'd?<br>
No, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp,<br>
And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee<br>
Where thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hear?<br>
Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice<br>
And could of men distinguish, her election<br>
Hath seal'd thee for herself; for thou hast been<br>
As one, in suffering all, that suffers nothing,<br>
A man that fortune's buffets and rewards<br>
Hast ta'en with equal thanks: and blest are those<br>
Whose blood and judgment are so well commingled,<br>
That they are not a pipe for fortune's finger<br>
To sound what stop she please. Give me that man<br>
That is not passion's slave, and I will wear him<br>
In my heart's core, ay, in my heart of heart,<br>
As I do thee. Something too much of this.<br>
There is a play to-night before the king;<br>
One scene of it comes near the circumstance<br>
Which I have told thee of my father's death:<br>
I prithee, when thou seest that act afoot,<br>
Even with the very comment of thy soul<br>
Observe mine uncle: if his occulted guilt<br>
Do not itself unkennel in one speech,<br>
It is a damned ghost that we have seen,<br>
And my imaginations are as foul<br>
As Vulcan's stithy. Give him heedful note;<br>
For I mine eyes will rivet to his face,<br>
And after we will both our judgments join<br>
In censure of his seeming.
<br><br><span class="character HORATIO">HORATIO</span>:
Well, my lord:<br>
If he steal aught the whilst this play is playing,<br>
And 'scape detecting, I will pay the theft.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:

Get you a place.

 <br><br><span class="character KING">KING CLAUDIUS</span>:
How fares our cousin Hamlet?
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Excellent, i' faith; of the chameleon's dish: I eat
the air, promise-crammed: you cannot feed capons so.
 <br><br><span class="character KING">KING CLAUDIUS</span>:
I have nothing with this answer, Hamlet; these words
are not mine.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
No, nor mine now.
To <span class="character POLONIUS">POLONIUS</span>:

My lord, you played once i' the university, you say?
<br><br><span class="character POLONIUS">LORD POLONIUS</span>:
That did I, my lord;<br> and was accounted a good actor.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
What did you enact?
<br><br><span class="character POLONIUS">LORD POLONIUS</span>:
I did enact Julius Caesar: I was killed i' the
Capitol;<br> Brutus killed me.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf
there. Be the players ready?
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROSENCRANTZ</span>:
Ay, my lord;<br> they stay upon your patience.
<br><br><span class="character QUEEN">QUEEN GERTRUDE</span>:
Come hither, my dear Hamlet, sit by me.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
No, good mother, here's metal more attractive.
<br><br><span class="character POLONIUS">LORD POLONIUS</span>:
[To  <br><br><span class="character KING">KING CLAUDIUS</span>:] O, ho! do you mark that?
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Lady, shall I lie in your lap?
<span class="actionstyle brackets">Lying down at <span class="character OPHELIA">OPHELIA</span>:'s feet</span>

<br><br><span class="character OPHELIA">OPHELIA</span>:
No, my lord.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
I mean, my head upon your lap?
<br><br><span class="character OPHELIA">OPHELIA</span>:
Ay, my lord.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Do you think I meant country matters?
<br><br><span class="character OPHELIA">OPHELIA</span>:
I think nothing, my lord.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
That's a fair thought to lie between maids' legs.
<br><br><span class="character OPHELIA">OPHELIA</span>:
What is, my lord?
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Nothing.
<br><br><span class="character OPHELIA">OPHELIA</span>:
You are merry, my lord.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Who, I?
<br><br><span class="character OPHELIA">OPHELIA</span>:
Ay, my lord.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
O God, your only jig-maker. What should a man do<br>
but be merry? for, look you, how cheerfully my<br>
mother looks, and my father died within these two hours.
<br><br><span class="character OPHELIA">OPHELIA</span>:
Nay, 'tis twice two months, my lord.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
So long? Nay then, let the devil wear black, for
I'll have a suit of sables. O heavens! die two
months ago, and not forgotten yet? Then there's
hope a great man's memory may outlive his life half
a year: but, by'r lady, he must build churches,
then;<br> or else shall he suffer not thinking on, with
the hobby-horse, whose epitaph is 'For, O, for, O,
the hobby-horse is forgot.'
Hautboys play. The dumb-show enters

<br><span class="actionstyle brackets">Enter a King and a Queen very lovingly;<br> the Queen embracing him, and he her. She kneels, and makes show of protestation unto him. He takes her up, and declines his head upon her neck: lays him down upon a bank of flowers: she, seeing him asleep, leaves him. Anon comes in a fellow, takes off his crown, kisses it, and pours poison in the King's ears, and exit. The Queen returns;<br> finds the King dead, and makes passionate action. The Poisoner, with some two or three Mutes, comes in again, seeming to lament with her. The dead body is carried away. The Poisoner wooes the Queen with gifts: she seems loath and unwilling awhile, but in the end accepts his love.

Ay, or any show that you'll show him: be not you

'Tis brief, my lord.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
As woman's love.
<br><span class="actionstyle brackets">Enter two <span class="character PLAYERS">PLAYERS</span>, King and Queen</span>.

<br><br><span class="character PLAYER-KING">Player King</span>:
Full thirty times hath Phoebus' cart gone round<br>
Neptune's salt wash and Tellus' orbed ground,<br>
And thirty dozen moons with borrow'd sheen<br>
About the world have times twelve thirties been,<br>
Since love our hearts and Hymen did our hands<br>
Unite commutual in most sacred bands.
<br><br><span class="character PLAYER-QUEEN">Player Queen</span>:
So many journeys may the sun and moon<br>
Make us again count o'er ere love be done!<br>
But, woe is me, you are so sick of late,<br>
So far from cheer and from your former state,<br>
That I distrust you. Yet, though I distrust,<br>
Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must:<br>
For women's fear and love holds quantity;<br>
In neither aught, or in extremity.<br>
Now, what my love is, proof hath made you know;<br>
And as my love is sized, my fear is so:<br>
Where love is great, the littlest doubts are fear;<br>
Where little fears grow great, great love grows there.
<br><br><span class="character PLAYER-KING">Player King</span>:
'Faith, I must leave thee, love, and shortly too;<br>
My operant powers their functions leave to do:<br>
And thou shalt live in this fair world behind,<br>
Honour'd, beloved; and haply one as kind<br>
For husband shalt thou
<br><br><span class="character PLAYER-QUEEN">Player Queen</span>:
O, confound the rest!<br>
Such love must needs be treason in my breast:<br>
In second husband let me be accurst!<br>
None wed the second but who kill'd the first.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
<span class="actionstyle brackets">[Aside]</span> Wormwood, wormwood.
<br><br><span class="character PLAYER-QUEEN">Player Queen</span>:
The instances that second marriage move<br>
Are base respects of thrift, but none of love:<br>
A second time I kill my husband dead,<br>
When second husband kisses me in bed.
<br><br><span class="character PLAYER-KING">Player King</span>:
I do believe you think what now you speak;<br>
But what we do determine oft we break.<br>
Purpose is but the slave to memory,<br>
Of violent birth, but poor validity;<br>
Which now, like fruit unripe, sticks on the tree;<br>
But fall, unshaken, when they mellow be.<br>
Most necessary 'tis that we forget<br>
To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt:<br>
What to ourselves in passion we propose,<br>
The passion ending, doth the purpose lose.<br>
The violence of either grief or joy<br>
Their own enactures with themselves destroy:<br>
Where joy most revels, grief doth most lament;<br>
Grief joys, joy grieves, on slender accident.<br>
This world is not for aye, nor 'tis not strange<br>
That even our loves should with our fortunes change;<br>
For 'tis a question left us yet to prove,<br>
Whether love lead fortune, or else fortune love.<br>
The great man down, you mark his favourite flies;<br>
The poor advanced makes friends of enemies.<br>
And hitherto doth love on fortune tend;<br>
For who not needs shall never lack a friend,<br>
And who in want a hollow friend doth try,<br>
Directly seasons him his enemy.<br>
But, orderly to end where I begun,<br>
Our wills and fates do so contrary run<br>
That our devices still are overthrown;<br>
Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our own:<br>
So think thou wilt no second husband wed;<br>
But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead.
<br><br><span class="character PLAYER-QUEEN">Player Queen</span>:
Nor earth to me give food, nor heaven light!<br>
Sport and repose lock from me day and night!<br>
To desperation turn my trust and hope!<br>
An anchor's cheer in prison be my scope!<br>
Each opposite that blanks the face of joy<br>
Meet what I would have well and it destroy!<br>
Both here and hence pursue me lasting strife,<br>
If, once a widow, ever I be wife!
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
If she should break it now!
<br><br><span class="character PLAYER-KING">Player King</span>:
'Tis deeply sworn. Sweet, leave me here awhile;<br>
My spirits grow dull, and fain I would beguile<br>
The tedious day with sleep.
<span class="actionstyle brackets">Sleeps</span>.

Madam, how like you this play?

The lady protests too much, methinks.

O, but she'll keep her word.
 <br><br><span class="character KING">KING CLAUDIUS</span>:
Have you heard the argument? Is there no offence in 't?
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
No, no, they do but jest, poison in jest;<br> no offence
i' the world.
 <br><br><span class="character KING">KING CLAUDIUS</span>:
What do you call the play?
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
The Mouse-trap. Marry, how? Tropically. This play
is the image of a murder done in Vienna: Gonzago is
the duke's name; his wife, Baptista: you shall see
anon; 'tis a knavish piece of work: but what o'
that? your majesty and we that have free souls, it
touches us not: let the galled jade wince, our
withers are unwrung.

Sir, a whole history.

The king, sir,--
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Ay, sir, what of him?
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUILDENSTERN</span>:
Is in his retirement marvellous distempered.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
With drink, sir?
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUILDENSTERN</span>:
No, my lord, rather with choler.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Your wisdom should show itself more richer to
signify this to his doctor; for, for me to put him
to his purgation would perhaps plunge him into far
more choler.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUILDENSTERN</span>:
Good my lord, put your discourse into some frame and
start not so wildly from my affair.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
I am tame, sir: pronounce.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUILDENSTERN</span>:
The queen, your mother, in most great affliction of

<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
You are welcome.

Nay, good my lord, this courtesy is not of the right

wholesome answer, I will do your mother's
commandment: if not, your pardon and my return
shall be the end of my business.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Sir, I cannot.
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUILDENSTERN</span>:
What, my lord?
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Make you a wholesome answer;<br> my wit's diseased: but,
sir, such answer as I can make, you shall command;<br>
or, rather, as you say, my mother: therefore no
more, but to the matter: my mother, you say,--
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROSENCRANTZ</span>:
Then thus she says;<br> your behavior hath struck her
into amazement and admiration.

O wonderful son, that can so astonish a mother! But
is there no sequel at the heels of this mother's
admiration? Impart.

She desires to speak with you in her closet, ere you

Sir, I lack advancement.

How can that be, when you have the voice of the king

And tell you what I know.

Thanks, dear my lord.

O, my offence is rank it smells to heaven;<br>
It hath the primal eldest curse upon't,<br>
A brother's murder. Pray can I not,<br>
Though inclination be as sharp as will:<br>
My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent;<br>
And, like a man to double business bound,<br>
I stand in pause where I shall first begin,<br>
And both neglect. What if this cursed hand<br>
Were thicker than itself with brother's blood,<br>
Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens<br>
To wash it white as snow? Whereto serves mercy<br>
But to confront the visage of offence?<br>
And what's in prayer but this two-fold force,<br>
To be forestalled ere we come to fall,<br>
Or pardon'd being down? Then I'll look up;<br>
My fault is past. But, O, what form of prayer<br>
Can serve my turn? 'Forgive me my foul murder'?<br>
That cannot be; since I am still possess'd<br>
Of those effects for which I did the murder,<br>
My crown, mine own ambition and my queen.<br>
May one be pardon'd and retain the offence?<br>
In the corrupted currents of this world<br>
Offence's gilded hand may shove by justice,<br>
And oft 'tis seen the wicked prize itself<br>
Buys out the law: but 'tis not so above;<br>
There is no shuffling, there the action lies<br>
In his true nature; and we ourselves compell'd,<br>
Even to the teeth and forehead of our faults,<br>
To give in evidence. What then? what rests?<br>
Try what repentance can: what can it not?<br>
Yet what can it when one can not repent?<br>
O wretched state! O bosom black as death!<br>
O limed soul, that, struggling to be free,<br>
Art more engaged! Help, angels! Make assay!<br>
Bow, stubborn knees; and, heart with strings of steel,<br>
Be soft as sinews of the newborn babe!<br>
All may be well.

Now might I do it pat, now he is praying;<br>
And now I'll do't. And so he goes to heaven;<br>
And so am I revenged. That would be scann'd:<br>
A villain kills my father; and for that,<br>
I, his sole son, do this same villain send<br>
To heaven.<br>
O, this is hire and salary, not revenge.<br>
He took my father grossly, full of bread;<br>
With all his crimes broad blown, as flush as May;<br>
And how his audit stands who knows save heaven?<br>
But in our circumstance and course of thought,<br>
'Tis heavy with him: and am I then revenged,<br>
To take him in the purging of his soul,<br>
When he is fit and season'd for his passage?<br>
No!<br>
Up, sword; and know thou a more horrid hent:<br>
When he is drunk asleep, or in his rage,<br>
Or in the incestuous pleasure of his bed;<br>
At gaming, swearing, or about some act<br>
That has no relish of salvation in't;<br>
Then trip him, that his heels may kick at heaven,<br>
And that his soul may be as damn'd and black<br>
As hell, whereto it goes. My mother stays:<br>

<br><br><span class="character POLONIUS">LORD POLONIUS</span>:
He will come straight. Look you lay home to him:<br>
Tell him his pranks have been too broad to bear with,<br>
And that your grace hath screen'd and stood between<br>
Much heat and him. I'll sconce me even here.<br>
Pray you, be round with him.

<br><span class="actionstyle brackets">Enter <span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span></span>

<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Now, mother, what's the matter?
<br><br><span class="character QUEEN">QUEEN GERTRUDE</span>:
Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Mother, you have my father much offended.
<br><br><span class="character QUEEN">QUEEN GERTRUDE</span>:
Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Go, go, you question with a wicked tongue.
<br><br><span class="character QUEEN">QUEEN GERTRUDE</span>:
Why, how now, Hamlet!
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
What's the matter now?
<br><br><span class="character QUEEN">QUEEN GERTRUDE</span>:
Have you forgot me?
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
No, by the rood, not so:<br>
You are the queen, your husband's brother's wife;<br>
And would it were not so! you are my mother.
<br><br><span class="character QUEEN">QUEEN GERTRUDE</span>:
Nay, then, I'll set those to you that can speak.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Come, come, and sit you down;<br> you shall not budge;<br>
You go not till I set you up a glass<br>
Where you may see the inmost part of you.
<br><br><span class="character QUEEN">QUEEN GERTRUDE</span>:
What wilt thou do? thou wilt not murder me?<br>
Help, help, ho!
<br><br><span class="character POLONIUS">LORD POLONIUS</span>:
[Behind] What, ho! help, help, help!

<br><br><span class="character QUEEN">QUEEN GERTRUDE</span>:
O me, what hast thou done?
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Nay, I know not:<br>
Is it the king?
<br><br><span class="character QUEEN">QUEEN GERTRUDE</span>:
O, what a rash and bloody deed is this!
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
A bloody deed! almost as bad, good mother,<br>
As kill a king, and marry with his brother.
<br><br><span class="character QUEEN">QUEEN GERTRUDE</span>:
As kill a king!
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Ay, lady, 'twas my word.
<br><span class="actionstyle brackets">Lifts up the array and discovers <br><br><span class="character POLONIUS">POLONIUS</span></span>.<br>

Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell!<br>
I took thee for thy better: take thy fortune;<br>
Thou find'st to be too busy is some danger.<br>
Leave wringing of your hands: peace! sit you down,<br>
And let me wring your heart; for so I shall,<br>
If it be made of penetrable stuff,<br>
If damned custom have not brass'd it so<br>
That it is proof and bulwark against sense.
<br><br><span class="character QUEEN">QUEEN GERTRUDE</span>:
What have I done, that thou darest wag thy tongue<br>
In noise so rude against me?
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Such an act<br>
That blurs the grace and blush of modesty,<br>
Calls virtue hypocrite, takes off the rose<br>
From the fair forehead of an innocent love<br>
And sets a blister there, makes marriage-vows<br>
As false as dicers' oaths: O, such a deed<br>
As from the body of contraction plucks<br>
The very soul, and sweet religion makes<br>
A rhapsody of words: heaven's face doth glow:<br>
Yea, this solidity and compound mass,<br>
With tristful visage, as against the doom,<br>
Is thought-sick at the act.
<br><br><span class="character QUEEN">QUEEN GERTRUDE</span>:
Ay me, what act,<br>
That roars so loud, and thunders in the index?
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Look here, upon this picture, and on this,<br>
The counterfeit presentment of two brothers.<br>
See, what a grace was seated on this brow;<br>
Hyperion's curls; the front of Jove himself;<br>
An eye like Mars, to threaten and command;<br>
A station like the herald Mercury<br>
New-lighted on a heaven-kissing hill;<br>
A combination and a form indeed,<br>
Where every god did seem to set his seal,<br>
To give the world assurance of a man:<br>
This was your husband. Look you now, what follows:<br>
Here is your husband; like a mildew'd ear,<br>
Blasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes?<br>
Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed,<br>
And batten on this moor? Ha! have you eyes?<br>
You cannot call it love; for at your age<br>
The hey-day in the blood is tame, it's humble,<br>
And waits upon the judgment: and what judgment<br>
Would step from this to this? Sense, sure, you have,<br>
Else could you not have motion; but sure, that sense<br>
Is apoplex'd; for madness would not err,<br>
Nor sense to ecstasy was ne'er so thrall'd<br>
But it reserved some quantity of choice,<br>
To serve in such a difference. What devil was't<br>
That thus hath cozen'd you at hoodman-blind?<br>
Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,<br>
Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,<br>
Or but a sickly part of one true sense<br>
Could not so mope.<br>
O shame! where is thy blush? Rebellious hell,<br>
If thou canst mutine in a matron's bones,<br>
To flaming youth let virtue be as wax,<br>
And melt in her own fire: proclaim no shame<br>
When the compulsive ardour gives the charge,<br>
Since frost itself as actively doth burn<br>
And reason panders will.
<br><br><span class="character QUEEN">QUEEN GERTRUDE</span>:
O Hamlet, speak no more:<br>
Thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soul;<br>
And there I see such black and grained spots<br>
As will not leave their tinct.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Nay, but to live<br>
In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed,<br>
Stew'd in corruption, honeying and making love<br>
Over the nasty sty,--
<br><br><span class="character QUEEN">QUEEN GERTRUDE</span>:
O, speak to me no more;<br>
These words, like daggers, enter in mine ears;<br>
No more, sweet Hamlet!
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
A murderer and a villain;<br>
A slave that is not twentieth part the tithe<br>
Of your precedent lord; a vice of kings;<br>
A cutpurse of the empire and the rule,<br>
That from a shelf the precious diadem stole,<br>
And put it in his pocket!
<br><br><span class="character QUEEN">QUEEN GERTRUDE</span>:
No more!
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
A king of shreds and patches,
<br><span class="actionstyle brackets">Enter Ghost</span>

Save me, and hover o'er me with your wings,<br>
You heavenly guards! What would your gracious figure?
<br><br><span class="character QUEEN">QUEEN GERTRUDE</span>:
Alas, he's mad!
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Do you not come your tardy son to chide,<br>
That, lapsed in time and passion, lets go by<br>
The important acting of your dread command? O, say!<br>
Ghost<br>
Do not forget: this visitation<br>
Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.<br>
But, look, amazement on thy mother sits:<br>
O, step between her and her fighting soul:<br>
Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works:<br>
Speak to her, Hamlet.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
How is it with you, lady?
<br><br><span class="character QUEEN">QUEEN GERTRUDE</span>:
Alas, how is't with you,<br>
That you do bend your eye on vacancy<br>
And with the incorporal air do hold discourse?<br>
Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep;<br>
And, as the sleeping soldiers in the alarm,<br>
Your bedded hair, like life in excrements,<br>
Starts up, and stands on end. O gentle son,<br>
Upon the heat and flame of thy distemper<br>
Sprinkle cool patience. Whereon do you look?
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
On him, on him! Look you, how pale he glares!<br>
His form and cause conjoin'd, preaching to stones,<br>
Would make them capable. Do not look upon me;<br>
Lest with this piteous action you convert<br>
My stern effects: then what I have to do<br>
Will want true colour; tears perchance for blood.
<br><br><span class="character QUEEN">QUEEN GERTRUDE</span>:
To whom do you speak this?
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Do you see nothing there?
<br><br><span class="character QUEEN">QUEEN GERTRUDE</span>:
Nothing at all;<br> yet all that is I see.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Nor did you nothing hear?
<br><br><span class="character QUEEN">QUEEN GERTRUDE</span>:
No, nothing but ourselves.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Why, look you there! look, how it steals away!
My father, in his habit as he lived!
Look, where he goes, even now, out at the portal!
<br><span class="actionstyle brackets"><br><span class="actionstyle brackets">Exit.</span> Ghost</span>

<br><br><span class="character QUEEN">QUEEN GERTRUDE</span>:
This the very coinage of your brain:
This bodiless creation ecstasy
Is very cunning in.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Ecstasy!<br>
My pulse, as yours, doth temperately keep time,<br>
And makes as healthful music: it is not madness<br>
That I have utter'd: bring me to the test,<br>
And I the matter will re-word; which madness<br>
Would gambol from. Mother, for love of grace,<br>
Lay not that mattering unction to your soul,<br>
That not your trespass, but my madness speaks:<br>
It will but skin and film the ulcerous place,<br>
Whilst rank corruption, mining all within,<br>
Infects unseen. Confess yourself to heaven;<br>
Repent what's past; avoid what is to come;<br>
And do not spread the compost on the weeds,<br>
To make them ranker. Forgive me this my virtue;<br>
For in the fatness of these pursy times<br>
Virtue itself of vice must pardon beg,<br>
Yea, curb and woo for leave to do him good.
<br><br><span class="character QUEEN">QUEEN GERTRUDE</span>:
O Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
O, throw away the worser part of it,<br>
And live the purer with the other half.<br>
Good night: but go not to mine uncle's bed;<br>
Assume a virtue, if you have it not.<br>
That monster, custom, who all sense doth eat,<br>
Of habits devil, is angel yet in this,<br>
That to the use of actions fair and good<br>
He likewise gives a frock or livery,<br>
That aptly is put on. Refrain to-night,<br>
And that shall lend a kind of easiness<br>
To the next abstinence: the next more easy;<br>
For use almost can change the stamp of nature,<br>
And either [ ] the devil, or throw him out<br>
With wondrous potency. Once more, good night:<br>
And when you are desirous to be bless'd,<br>
I'll blessing beg of you. For this same lord,
<span class="actionstyle brackets">Pointing to <br><br><span class="character POLONIUS">POLONIUS</span></span>

I do repent: but heaven hath pleased it so,<br>
To punish me with this and this with me,<br>
That I must be their scourge and minister.<br>
I will bestow him, and will answer well<br>
The death I gave him. So, again, good night.<br>
I must be cruel, only to be kind:<br>
Thus bad begins and worse remains behind.<br>
One word more, good lady.
<br><br><span class="character QUEEN">QUEEN GERTRUDE</span>:
What shall I do?
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Not this, by no means, that I bid you do:<br>
Let the bloat king tempt you again to bed;<br>
Pinch wanton on your cheek; call you his mouse;<br>
And let him, for a pair of reechy kisses,<br>
Or paddling in your neck with his damn'd fingers,<br>
Make you to ravel all this matter out,<br>
That I essentially am not in madness,<br>
But mad in craft. 'Twere good you let him know;<br>
For who, that's but a queen, fair, sober, wise,<br>
Would from a paddock, from a bat, a gib,<br>
Such dear concernings hide? who would do so?<br>
No, in despite of sense and secrecy,<br>
Unpeg the basket on the house's top.<br>
Let the birds fly, and, like the famous ape,<br>
To try conclusions, in the basket creep,<br>
And break your own neck down.
<br><br><span class="character QUEEN">QUEEN GERTRUDE</span>:
Be thou assured, if words be made of breath,<br>
And breath of life, I have no life to breathe<br>
What thou hast said to me.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
I must to England;<br> you know that?
<br><br><span class="character QUEEN">QUEEN GERTRUDE</span>:
Alack,
I had forgot: 'tis so concluded on.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
There's letters seal'd: and my two schoolfellows,<br>
Whom I will trust as I will adders fang'd,<br>
They bear the mandate; they must sweep my way,<br>
And marshal me to knavery. Let it work;<br>
For 'tis the sport to have the engineer<br>
Hoist with his own petard: and 't shall go hard<br>
But I will delve one yard below their mines,<br>
And blow them at the moon: O, 'tis most sweet,<br>
When in one line two crafts directly meet.<br>
This man shall set me packing:<br>
I'll lug the guts into the neighbour room.<br>
Mother, good night. Indeed this counsellor<br>
Is now most still, most secret and most grave,<br>
Who was in life a foolish prating knave.<br>
Come, sir, to draw toward an end with you.<br>
Good night, mother.

 <br><br><span class="character KING">KING CLAUDIUS</span>:
There's matter in these sighs, these profound heaves:
You must translate: 'tis fit we understand them.
Where is your son?
<br><br><span class="character QUEEN">QUEEN GERTRUDE</span>:
Bestow this place on us a little while.
<br><span class="actionstyle brackets">Exeunt <span class="character ROS">ROSENCRANTZ</span> and <span class="character GUIL">GUILDENSTERN</span></span>.<br>

Ah, my good lord, what have I seen to-night!
 <br><br><span class="character KING">KING CLAUDIUS</span>:
What, Gertrude? How does Hamlet?
<br><br><span class="character QUEEN">QUEEN GERTRUDE</span>:
Mad as the sea and wind, when both contend<br>
Which is the mightier: in his lawless fit,<br>
Behind the arras hearing something stir,<br>
Whips out his rapier, cries, 'A rat, a rat!'<br>
And, in this brainish apprehension, kills<br>
The unseen good old man.
 <br><br><span class="character KING">KING CLAUDIUS</span>:
O heavy deed!<br>
It had been so with us, had we been there:<br>
His liberty is full of threats to all;<br>
To you yourself, to us, to every one.<br>
Alas, how shall this bloody deed be answer'd?<br>
It will be laid to us, whose providence<br>
Should have kept short, restrain'd and out of haunt,<br>
This mad young man: but so much was our love,<br>
We would not understand what was most fit;<br>
But, like the owner of a foul disease,<br>
To keep it from divulging, let it feed<br>
Even on the pith of Life. Where is he gone?
<br><br><span class="character QUEEN">QUEEN GERTRUDE</span>:
To draw apart the body he hath kill'd:<br>
O'er whom his very madness, like some ore<br>
Among a mineral of metals base,<br>
Shows itself pure;<br> he weeps for what is done.
 <br><br><span class="character KING">KING CLAUDIUS</span>:
O Gertrude, come away!
The sun no sooner shall the mountains touch,<br>
But we will ship him hence: and this vile deed<br>
We must, with all our majesty and skill,<br>
Both countenance and excuse. Ho, Guildenstern!
<br><span class="actionstyle brackets">Re-enter <span class="character ROS">ROSENCRANTZ</span> and <span class="character GUIL">GUILDENSTERN</span></span>

Friends both, go join you with some further aid:<br>
Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain,<br>
And from his mother's closet hath he dragg'd him:<br>
Go seek him out; speak fair, and bring the body<br>
Into the chapel. I pray you, haste in this.
<br><span class="actionstyle brackets">Exeunt <span class="character ROS">ROSENCRANTZ</span> and <span class="character GUIL">GUILDENSTERN</span></span>.<br>

Come, Gertrude, we'll call up our wisest friends;<br>

<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Safely stowed.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROSENCRANTZ</span>:,<span class="character GUIL">GUILDENSTERN</span>::
[Within] Hamlet! Lord Hamlet!
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:

O, here they come.
<br><span class="actionstyle brackets">Enter <span class="character ROS">ROSENCRANTZ</span> and <span class="character GUIL">GUILDENSTERN</span></span>.<br>

<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROSENCRANTZ</span>:
What have you done, my lord, with the dead body?
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Compounded it with dust, whereto 'tis kin.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROSENCRANTZ</span>:
Tell us where 'tis, that we may take it thence
And bear it to the chapel.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Do not believe it.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROSENCRANTZ</span>:
Believe what?
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
That I can keep your counsel and not mine own.
Besides, to be demanded of a sponge! what
replication should be made by the son of a king?
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROSENCRANTZ</span>:
Take you me for a sponge, my lord?
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Ay, sir, that soaks up the king's countenance, his
rewards, his authorities. But such officers do the
king best service in the end: he keeps them, like
an ape, in the corner of his jaw;<br> first mouthed, to
be last swallowed: when he needs what you have
gleaned, it is but squeezing you, and, sponge, you
shall be dry again.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROSENCRANTZ</span>:
I understand you not, my lord.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
I am glad of it: a knavish speech sleeps in a
foolish ear.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROSENCRANTZ</span>:
My lord, you must tell us where the body is, and go
with us to the king.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
The body is with the king, but the king is not with
the body. The king is a thing--
<br><br><span class="character GUIL">GUILDENSTERN</span>:
A thing, my lord!
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Of nothing: bring me to him. Hide fox, and all after.

SCENE III. <br><span class="actionstyle brackets">Another room in the castle.

Enter <span class="character KING">KING CLAUDIUS</span>, attended</span>.
 <br><br><span class="character KING">KING CLAUDIUS</span>:
I have sent to seek him, and to find the body.<br>
How dangerous is it that this man goes loose!<br>
Yet must not we put the strong law on him:<br>
He's loved of the distracted multitude,<br>
Who like not in their judgment, but their eyes;<br>
And where tis so, the offender's scourge is weigh'd,<br>
But never the offence. To bear all smooth and even,<br>
This sudden sending him away must seem<br>
Deliberate pause: diseases desperate grown<br>
By desperate appliance are relieved,<br>
Or not at all.
<br><span class="actionstyle brackets">Enter <span class="character ROS">ROSENCRANTZ</span></span>.<br>

How now! what hath befall'n?
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROSENCRANTZ</span>:
Where the dead body is bestow'd, my lord,
We cannot get from him.
 <br><br><span class="character KING">KING CLAUDIUS</span>:
But where is he?
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROSENCRANTZ</span>:
Without, my lord;<br> guarded, to know your pleasure.
 <br><br><span class="character KING">KING CLAUDIUS</span>:
Bring him before us.
<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROSENCRANTZ</span>:
Ho, Guildenstern! bring in my lord.
Enter <span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span> and <span class="character GUIL">GUILDENSTERN</span>:

 <br><br><span class="character KING">KING CLAUDIUS</span>:
Now, Hamlet, where's Polonius?
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
At supper.
 <br><br><span class="character KING">KING CLAUDIUS</span>:
At supper! where?
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Not where he eats, but where he is eaten: a certain
convocation of politic worms are e'en at him. Your
worm is your only emperor for diet: we fat all
creatures else to fat us, and we fat ourselves for
maggots: your fat king and your lean beggar is but
variable service, two dishes, but to one table:
that's the end.
 <br><br><span class="character KING">KING CLAUDIUS</span>:
Alas, alas!
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
A man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a
king, and cat of the fish that hath fed of that worm.
 <br><br><span class="character KING">KING CLAUDIUS</span>:
What dost you mean by this?
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Nothing but to show you how a king may go a
progress through the guts of a beggar.
 <br><br><span class="character KING">KING CLAUDIUS</span>:
Where is Polonius?
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
In heaven;<br> send hither to see: if your messenger
find him not there, seek him i' the other place
yourself. But indeed, if you find him not within
this month, you shall nose him as you go up the
stairs into the lobby.
 <br><br><span class="character KING">KING CLAUDIUS</span>:
Go seek him there.
To some Attendants

<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
He will stay till ye come.
<br><span class="actionstyle brackets">Exeunt Attendants</span>.

 <br><br><span class="character KING">KING CLAUDIUS</span>:
Hamlet, this deed, for thine especial safety,<br>
Which we do tender, as we dearly grieve<br>
For that which thou hast done, must send thee hence<br>
With fiery quickness: therefore prepare thyself;<br>
The bark is ready, and the wind at help,<br>
The associates tend, and every thing is bent<br>
For England.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
For England!
 <br><br><span class="character KING">KING CLAUDIUS</span>:
Ay, Hamlet.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Good.
 <br><br><span class="character KING">KING CLAUDIUS</span>:
So is it, if thou knew'st our purposes.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
I see a cherub that sees them. But, come;<br> for
England! Farewell, dear mother.
 <br><br><span class="character KING">KING CLAUDIUS</span>:
Thy loving father, Hamlet.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
My mother: father and mother is man and wife; man
and wife is one flesh;<br> and so, my mother. Come, for England!
<br><span class="actionstyle brackets">Exit.</span>

 <br><br><span class="character KING">KING CLAUDIUS</span>:
Follow him at foot;<br> tempt him with speed aboard;<br>
Delay it not;<br> I'll have him hence to-night:<br>
Away! for every thing is seal'd and done<br>
That else leans on the affair: pray you, make haste.
<br><span class="actionstyle brackets">Exeunt <span class="character ROS">ROSENCRANTZ</span> and <span class="character GUIL">GUILDENSTERN</span></span>.<br>

And, England, if my love thou hold'st at aught<br>
As my great power thereof may give thee sense,<br>
Since yet thy cicatrice looks raw and red<br>
After the Danish sword, and thy free awe<br>
Pays homage to us--thou mayst not coldly set<br>
Our sovereign process; which imports at full,<br>
By letters congruing to that effect,<br>
The present death of Hamlet. Do it, England;<br>
For like the hectic in my blood he rages,<br>
And thou must cure me: till I know 'tis done,<br>
Howe'er my haps, my joys were ne'er begun.

<br><br><span class="character FORTINBRAS">PRINCE FORTINBRAS</span>:
Go, captain, from me greet the Danish king;<br>
Tell him that, by his licence, Fortinbras<br>
Craves the conveyance of a promised march<br>
Over his kingdom. You know the rendezvous.<br>
If that his majesty would aught with us,<br>
We shall express our duty in his eye;<br>
And let him know so.
<br><br><span class="character CAPTAIN">Captain</span>:
I will do't, my lord.

<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Good sir, whose powers are these?
<br><br><span class="character CAPTAIN">Captain</span>:
They are of Norway, sir.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
How purposed, sir, I pray you?
<br><br><span class="character CAPTAIN">Captain</span>:
Against some part of Poland.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Who commands them, sir?
<br><br><span class="character CAPTAIN">Captain</span>:
The nephews to old Norway, Fortinbras.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Goes it against the main of Poland, sir,
Or for some frontier?
<br><br><span class="character CAPTAIN">Captain</span>:
Truly to speak, and with no addition,<br>
We go to gain a little patch of ground<br>
That hath in it no profit but the name.<br>
To pay five ducats, five, I would not farm it;<br>
Nor will it yield to Norway or the Pole<br>
A ranker rate, should it be sold in fee.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Why, then the Polack never will defend it.
<br><br><span class="character CAPTAIN">Captain</span>:
Yes, it is already garrison'd.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats<br>
Will not debate the question of this straw:<br>
This is the imposthume of much wealth and peace,<br>
That inward breaks, and shows no cause without<br>
Why the man dies. I humbly thank you, sir.
<br><br><span class="character CAPTAIN">Captain</span>:
God be wi' you, sir.
<br><span class="actionstyle brackets">Exit.</span>

<br><br><span class="character ROS">ROSENCRANTZ</span>:

I'll be with you straight go a little before.
<br><span class="actionstyle brackets">Exeunt all except <span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span></span>.<br>

How all occasions do inform against me,<br>
And spur my dull revenge! What is a man,<br>
If his chief good and market of his time<br>
Be but to sleep and feed? a beast, no more.<br>
Sure, he that made us with such large discourse,<br>
Looking before and after, gave us not<br>
That capability and god-like reason<br>
To fust in us unused. Now, whether it be<br>
Bestial oblivion, or some craven scruple<br>
Of thinking too precisely on the event,<br>
A thought which, quarter'd, hath but one part wisdom<br>
And ever three parts coward, I do not know<br>
Why yet I live to say 'This thing's to do;<br>
Sith I have cause and will and strength and means<br>
To do't. Examples gross as earth exhort me:<br>
Witness this army of such mass and charge<br>
Led by a delicate and tender prince,<br>
Whose spirit with divine ambition puff'd<br>
Makes mouths at the invisible event,<br>
Exposing what is mortal and unsure<br>
To all that fortune, death and danger dare,<br>
Even for an egg-shell. Rightly to be great<br>
Is not to stir without great argument,<br>
But greatly to find quarrel in a straw<br>
When honour's at the stake. How stand I then,<br>
That have a father kill'd, a mother stain'd,<br>
Excitements of my reason and my blood,<br>
And let all sleep? while, to my shame, I see<br>
The imminent death of twenty thousand men,<br>
That, for a fantasy and trick of fame,<br>
Go to their graves like beds, fight for a plot<br>
Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause,<br>
Which is not tomb enough and continent<br>
To hide the slain? O, from this time forth,<br>
My thoughts be bloody, or be nothing worth!

SCENE V. <br><span class="actionstyle brackets">Elsinore. A room in the castle.

<br><br><span class="character QUEEN">QUEEN GERTRUDE</span>:
I will not speak with her.
<br><br><span class="character GENTLEMAN">Gentleman</span>:
She is importunate, indeed distract:<br>
Her mood will needs be pitied.
<br><br><span class="character QUEEN">QUEEN GERTRUDE</span>:
What would she have?
<br><br><span class="character GENTLEMAN">Gentleman</span>:
She speaks much of her father; says she hears<br>
There's tricks i' the world; and hems, and beats her heart;<br>
Spurns enviously at straws; speaks things in doubt,<br>
That carry but half sense: her speech is nothing,<br>
Yet the unshaped use of it doth move<br>
The hearers to collection; they aim at it,<br>
And botch the words up fit to their own thoughts;<br>
Which, as her winks, and nods, and gestures
yield them,<br>
Indeed would make one think there might be thought,<br>
Though nothing sure, yet much unhappily.
<br><br><span class="character HORATIO">HORATIO</span>:
'Twere good she were spoken with; for she may strew<br>
Dangerous conjectures in ill-breeding minds.
<br><br><span class="character QUEEN">QUEEN GERTRUDE</span>:
Let her come in.
<br><span class="actionstyle brackets">Exit.</span> <br><br><span class="character HORATIO">HORATIO</span>:

To my sick soul, as sin's true nature is,<br>
Each toy seems prologue to some great amiss:<br>
So full of artless jealousy is guilt,<br>
It spills itself in fearing to be spilt.

<br><br><span class="character QUEEN">QUEEN GERTRUDE</span>:
How now, Ophelia!

How should I your true love know<br>
From another one?<br>
By his cockle hat and staff,<br>
And his sandal shoon.
<br><br><span class="character QUEEN">QUEEN GERTRUDE</span>:
Alas, sweet lady, what imports this song?

Say you? nay, pray you, mark.

He is dead and gone, lady,<br>
He is dead and gone;<br>
At his head a grass-green turf,<br>
At his heels a stone.

Nay, but, Ophelia,--

<span class="actionstyle brackets">Sings</span>:
Larded with sweet flowers<br>
Which bewept to the grave did go<br>
With true-love showers.
 <br><br><span class="character KING">KING CLAUDIUS</span>:
How do you, pretty lady?
<br><br><span class="character OPHELIA">OPHELIA</span>:
Well, God 'ild you! They say the owl was a baker's
daughter. Lord, we know what we are, but know not
what we may be. God be at your table!
 <br><br><span class="character KING">KING CLAUDIUS</span>:
Conceit upon her father.
<br><br><span class="character OPHELIA">OPHELIA</span>:
Pray you, let's have no words of this; but when they
ask you what it means, say you this:
<span class="actionstyle brackets">Sings</span>:

To-morrow is Saint Valentine's day,<br>
All in the morning betime,<br>
And I a maid at your window,<br>
To be your Valentine.<br>
Then up he rose, and donn'd his clothes,<br>
And dupp'd the chamber-door;<br>
Let in the maid, that out a maid<br>
Never departed more.
 <br><br><span class="character KING">KING CLAUDIUS</span>:
Pretty Ophelia!
<br><br><span class="character OPHELIA">OPHELIA</span>:
Indeed, la, without an oath, I'll make an end on't:
<span class="actionstyle brackets">Sings</span>:

By Gis and by Saint Charity,<br>
Alack, and fie for shame!<br>
Young men will do't, if they come to't;<br>
By cock, they are to blame.<br>
Quoth she, before you tumbled me,<br>
You promised me to wed.<br>
So would I ha' done, by yonder sun,<br>
An thou hadst not come to my bed.
 <br><br><span class="character KING">KING CLAUDIUS</span>:
How long hath she been thus?
<br><br><span class="character OPHELIA">OPHELIA</span>:
I hope all will be well. We must be patient: but I
cannot choose but weep, to think they should lay him
i' the cold ground. My brother shall know of it:
and so I thank you for your good counsel. Come, my
coach! Good night, ladies;<br> good night, sweet ladies;<br>
good night, good night.
<br><span class="actionstyle brackets">Exit.</span>

Follow her close;<br> give her good watch,
I pray you.
<br><span class="actionstyle brackets">Exit.</span> <br><br><span class="character HORATIO">HORATIO</span>:

O, this is the poison of deep grief; it springs<br>
All from her father's death. O Gertrude, Gertrude,<br>
When sorrows come, they come not single spies<br>
But in battalions. First, her father slain:<br>
Next, your son gone; and he most violent author<br>
Of his own just remove: the people muddied,<br>
Thick and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers,<br>
For good Polonius' death; and we have done but greenly,<br>
In hugger-mugger to inter him: poor Ophelia<br>
Divided from herself and her fair judgment,<br>
Without the which we are pictures, or mere beasts:<br>
Last, and as much containing as all these,<br>
Her brother is in secret come from France;<br>
Feeds on his wonder, keeps himself in clouds,<br>
And wants not buzzers to infect his ear<br>
With pestilent speeches of his father's death;<br>
Wherein necessity, of matter beggar'd,<br>
Will nothing stick our person to arraign<br>
In ear and ear. O my dear Gertrude, this,<br>
Like to a murdering-piece, in many places<br>
Gives me superfluous death.<br>
A noise within

<br><br><span class="character QUEEN">QUEEN GERTRUDE</span>:
Alack, what noise is this?
 <br><br><span class="character KING">KING CLAUDIUS</span>:
Where are my Switzers? Let them guard the door.
<br><span class="actionstyle brackets">Enter another <br><br><span class="character GENTLEMAN">Gentleman</span></span>.<br>

What is the matter?
<br><br><span class="character GENTLEMAN">Gentleman</span>:
Save yourself, my lord:<br>
The ocean, overpeering of his list,<br>
Eats not the flats with more impetuous haste<br>
Than young Laertes, in a riotous head,<br>
O'erbears your officers. The rabble call him lord;<br>
And, as the world were now but to begin,<br>
Antiquity forgot, custom not known,<br>
The ratifiers and props of every word,<br>
They cry 'Choose we: Laertes shall be king:'<br>
Caps, hands, and tongues, applaud it to the clouds:<br>
'Laertes shall be king, Laertes king!'
<br><br><span class="character QUEEN">QUEEN GERTRUDE</span>:
How cheerfully on the false trail they cry!<br>
O, this is counter, you false Danish dogs!
 <br><br><span class="character KING">KING CLAUDIUS</span>:
The doors are broke.<br>
Noise within

<br><span class="actionstyle brackets">Enter <span class="character LAERTES">LAERTES</span>, armed;<br> <span class="character DANES">Danes</span> following</span>.

<br><br><span class="character DANES">Danes</span>:
No, let's come in.
<br><br><span class="character LAERTES">LAERTES</span>:
I pray you, give me leave.
<br><br><span class="character DANES">Danes</span>:
We will, we will.<br>
They retire without the door

<br><br><span class="character LAERTES">LAERTES</span>:
I thank you: keep the door. O thou vile king,<br>
Give me my father!
<br><br><span class="character QUEEN">QUEEN GERTRUDE</span>:
Calmly, good Laertes.
<br><br><span class="character LAERTES">LAERTES</span>:
That drop of blood that's calm proclaims me bastard,<br>
Cries cuckold to my father, brands the harlot<br>
Even here, between the chaste unsmirched brow<br>
Of my true mother.
 <br><br><span class="character KING">KING CLAUDIUS</span>:
What is the cause, Laertes,<br>
That thy rebellion looks so giant-like?<br>
Let him go, Gertrude; do not fear our person:<br>
There's such divinity doth hedge a king,<br>
That treason can but peep to what it would,<br>
Acts little of his will. Tell me, Laertes,<br>
Why thou art thus incensed. Let him go, Gertrude.<br>
Speak, man.
<br><br><span class="character LAERTES">LAERTES</span>:
Where is my father?
 <br><br><span class="character KING">KING CLAUDIUS</span>:
Dead.
<br><br><span class="character QUEEN">QUEEN GERTRUDE</span>:
But not by him.
 <br><br><span class="character KING">KING CLAUDIUS</span>:
Let him demand his fill.
<br><br><span class="character LAERTES">LAERTES</span>:
How came he dead? I'll not be juggled with:<br>
To hell, allegiance! vows, to the blackest devil!<br>
Conscience and grace, to the profoundest pit!<br>
I dare damnation. To this point I stand,<br>
That both the worlds I give to negligence,<br>
Let come what comes; only I'll be revenged<br>
Most thoroughly for my father.
 <br><br><span class="character KING">KING CLAUDIUS</span>:
Who shall stay you?
<br><br><span class="character LAERTES">LAERTES</span>:
My will, not all the world:<br>
And for my means, I'll husband them so well,<br>
They shall go far with little.
 <br><br><span class="character KING">KING CLAUDIUS</span>:
Good Laertes,<br>
If you desire to know the certainty<br>
Of your dear father's death, is't writ in your revenge,<br>
That, swoopstake, you will draw both friend and foe,<br>
Winner and loser?
<br><br><span class="character LAERTES">LAERTES</span>:
None but his enemies.
 <br><br><span class="character KING">KING CLAUDIUS</span>:
Will you know them then?
<br><br><span class="character LAERTES">LAERTES</span>:
To his good friends thus wide I'll ope my arms;<br>
And like the kind life-rendering pelican,<br>
Repast them with my blood.
 <br><br><span class="character KING">KING CLAUDIUS</span>:
Why, now you speak<br>
Like a good child and a true gentleman.<br>
That I am guiltless of your father's death,<br>
And am most sensible in grief for it,<br>
It shall as level to your judgment pierce<br>
As day does to your eye.
<br><br><span class="character DANES">Danes</span>:
[Within] Let her come in.
<br><br><span class="character LAERTES">LAERTES</span>:
How now! what noise is that?
Re-enter <span class="character OPHELIA">OPHELIA</span>:

O heat, dry up my brains! tears seven times salt,<br>
Burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye!<br>
By heaven, thy madness shall be paid by weight,<br>
Till our scale turn the beam. O rose of May!<br>
Dear maid, kind sister, sweet Ophelia!<br>
O heavens! is't possible, a young maid's wits<br>
Should be as moral as an old man's life?<br>
Nature is fine in love, and where 'tis fine,<br>
It sends some precious instance of itself<br>
After the thing it loves.
<br><br><span class="character OPHELIA">OPHELIA</span>:
[Sings]<br>
They bore him barefaced on the bier;<br>
Hey non nonny, nonny, hey nonny;<br>

Fare you well, my dove!

Hadst thou thy wits, and didst persuade revenge,<br>
It could not move thus.

You must sing a-down a-down,<br>

O, how the wheel becomes it! It is the false<br>
steward, that stole his master's daughter.

This nothing's more than matter.

There's rosemary, that's for remembrance; pray,
love, remember: and there is pansies. that's for thoughts.
<br><br><span class="character LAERTES">LAERTES</span>:
A document in madness, thoughts and remembrance fitted.
<br><br><span class="character OPHELIA">OPHELIA</span>:
There's fennel for you, and columbines: there's rue
for you; and here's some for me: we may call it
herb-grace o' Sundays: O you must wear your rue with
a difference. There's a daisy: I would give you
some violets, but they withered all when my father
died: they say he made a good end,
Sings

For bonny sweet Robin is all my joy.
<br><br><span class="character LAERTES">LAERTES</span>:
Thought and affliction, passion, hell itself,<br>
She turns to favour and to prettiness.

And will he not come again?<br>
And will he not come again?<br>
No, no, he is dead:<br>
Go to thy death-bed:<br>
He never will come again.<br>
His beard was as white as snow,<br>
All flaxen was his poll:<br>
He is gone, he is gone,<br>
And we cast away moan:<br>
God ha' mercy on his soul!<br>
And of all Christian souls, I pray God. God be wi' ye.

<br><br><span class="character LAERTES">LAERTES</span>:
Do you see this, O God?
 <br><br><span class="character KING">KING CLAUDIUS</span>:
Laertes, I must commune with your grief,<br>
Or you deny me right. Go but apart,<br>
Make choice of whom your wisest friends you will.<br>
And they shall hear and judge 'twixt you and me:<br>
If by direct or by collateral hand<br>
They find us touch'd, we will our kingdom give,<br>
Our crown, our life, and all that we can ours,<br>
To you in satisfaction; but if not,<br>
Be you content to lend your patience to us,<br>
And we shall jointly labour with your soul<br>
To give it due content.
<br><br><span class="character LAERTES">LAERTES</span>:
Let this be so;<br>
His means of death, his obscure funeral<br>
No trophy, sword, nor hatchment o'er his bones,<br>
No noble rite nor formal ostentation<br>
Cry to be heard, as 'twere from heaven to earth,<br>
That I must call't in question.
 <br><br><span class="character KING">KING CLAUDIUS</span>:
So you shall;<br>
And where the offence is let the great axe fall.<br>
I pray you, go with me.<br>

First Sailor
God bless you, sir.
<br><br><span class="character HORATIO">HORATIO</span>:
Let him bless thee too.
First Sailor
He shall, sir, an't please him. There's a letter for
you, sir; it comes from the ambassador that was
bound for England; if your name be Horatio, as I am
let to know it is.
<br><br><span class="character HORATIO">HORATIO</span>:
[Reads] 'Horatio, when thou shalt have overlooked
this, give these fellows some means to the king:
they have letters for him. Ere we were two days old
at sea, a pirate of very warlike appointment gave us
chase. Finding ourselves too slow of sail, we put on
a compelled valour, and in the grapple I boarded
them: on the instant they got clear of our ship; so
I alone became their prisoner. They have dealt with
me like thieves of mercy: but they knew what they
did; I am to do a good turn for them. Let the king
have the letters I have sent; and repair thou to me
with as much speed as thou wouldst fly death. I
have words to speak in thine ear will make thee
dumb; yet are they much too light for the bore of
the matter. These good fellows will bring thee
where I am. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern hold their
course for England: of them I have much to tell
thee. Farewell.
'He that thou knowest thine, <span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:.'
Come, I will make you way for these your letters;<br>
And do't the speedier, that you may direct me<br>
To him from whom you brought them.

 <br><br><span class="character KING">KING CLAUDIUS</span>:
Now must your conscience my acquaintance seal,<br>
And you must put me in your heart for friend,<br>
Sith you have heard, and with a knowing ear,<br>
That he which hath your noble father slain<br>
Pursued my life.
<br><br><span class="character LAERTES">LAERTES</span>:
It well appears: but tell me<br>
Why you proceeded not against these feats,<br>
So crimeful and so capital in nature,<br>
As by your safety, wisdom, all things else,<br>
You mainly were stirr'd up.
 <br><br><span class="character KING">KING CLAUDIUS</span>:
O, for two special reasons;<br>
Which may to you, perhaps, seem much unsinew'd,<br>
But yet to me they are strong. The queen his mother<br>
Lives almost by his looks;<br> and for myself<br>
My virtue or my plague, be it either which<br>
She's so conjunctive to my life and soul,<br>
That, as the star moves not but in his sphere,<br>
I could not but by her. The other motive,<br>
Why to a public count I might not go,<br>
Is the great love the general gender bear him;<br>
Who, dipping all his faults in their affection,<br>
Would, like the spring that turneth wood to stone,<br>
Convert his gyves to graces; so that my arrows,<br>
Too slightly timber'd for so loud a wind,<br>
Would have reverted to my bow again,<br>
And not where I had aim'd them.
<br><br><span class="character LAERTES">LAERTES</span>:
And so have I a noble father lost;<br>
A sister driven into desperate terms,<br>
Whose worth, if praises may go back again,<br>
Stood challenger on mount of all the age<br>
For her perfections: but my revenge will come.
 <br><br><span class="character KING">KING CLAUDIUS</span>:
Break not your sleeps for that: you must not think<br>
That we are made of stuff so flat and dull<br>
That we can let our beard be shook with danger<br>
And think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more:<br>
I loved your father, and we love ourself;<br>
And that, I hope, will teach you to imagine<br>

How now! what news?<br>
Messenger<br>
Letters, my lord, from Hamlet:<br>
This to your majesty;<br> this to the queen.
 <br><br><span class="character KING">KING CLAUDIUS</span>:
From Hamlet! who brought them?
Messenger
Sailors, my lord, they say;<br> I saw them not:<br>
They were given me by Claudio; he received them<br>
Of him that brought them.

Laertes, you shall hear them. Leave us.

'High and mighty, You shall know I am set naked on
your kingdom. To-morrow shall I beg leave to see
your kingly eyes: when I shall, first asking your
pardon thereunto, recount the occasion of my sudden
and more strange return. '<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:.'
What should this mean? Are all the rest come back?<br>
Or is it some abuse, and no such thing?
<br><br><span class="character LAERTES">LAERTES</span>:
Know you the hand?
 <br><br><span class="character KING">KING CLAUDIUS</span>:
'Tis Hamlets character. 'Naked!<br>
And in a postscript here, he says 'alone.'<br>
Can you advise me?
<br><br><span class="character LAERTES">LAERTES</span>:
I'm lost in it, my lord. But let him come;<br>
It warms the very sickness in my heart,<br>
That I shall live and tell him to his teeth,<br>
'Thus didest thou.'
 <br><br><span class="character KING">KING CLAUDIUS</span>:
If it be so, Laertes<br>
As how should it be so? how otherwise?<br>
Will you be ruled by me?
<br><br><span class="character LAERTES">LAERTES</span>:
Ay, my lord;<br>
So you will not o'errule me to a peace.
 <br><br><span class="character KING">KING CLAUDIUS</span>:
To thine own peace. If he be now return'd,<br>
As checking at his voyage, and that he means<br>
No more to undertake it, I will work him<br>
To an exploit, now ripe in my device,<br>
Under the which he shall not choose but fall:<br>
And for his death no wind of blame shall breathe,<br>
But even his mother shall uncharge the practise<br>
And call it accident.
<br><br><span class="character LAERTES">LAERTES</span>:
My lord, I will be ruled;<br>
The rather, if you could devise it so<br>
That I might be the organ.
 <br><br><span class="character KING">KING CLAUDIUS</span>:
It falls right.<br>
You have been talk'd of since your travel much,<br>
And that in Hamlet's hearing, for a quality<br>
Wherein, they say, you shine: your sum of parts<br>
Did not together pluck such envy from him<br>
As did that one, and that, in my regard,<br>
Of the unworthiest siege.
<br><br><span class="character LAERTES">LAERTES</span>:
What part is that, my lord?
 <br><br><span class="character KING">KING CLAUDIUS</span>:
A very riband in the cap of youth,<br>
Yet needful too; for youth no less becomes<br>
The light and careless livery that it wears<br>
Than settled age his sables and his weeds,<br>
Importing health and graveness. Two months since,<br>
Here was a gentleman of Normandy:<br>
I've seen myself, and served against, the French,<br>
And they can well on horseback: but this gallant<br>
Had witchcraft in't; he grew unto his seat;<br>
And to such wondrous doing brought his horse,<br>
As he had been incorpsed and demi-natured<br>
With the brave beast: so far he topp'd my thought,<br>
That I, in forgery of shapes and tricks,<br>
Come short of what he did.
<br><br><span class="character LAERTES">LAERTES</span>:
A Norman was't?
 <br><br><span class="character KING">KING CLAUDIUS</span>:
A Norman.
<br><br><span class="character LAERTES">LAERTES</span>:
Upon my life, Lamond.
 <br><br><span class="character KING">KING CLAUDIUS</span>:
The very same.
<br><br><span class="character LAERTES">LAERTES</span>:
I know him well: he is the brooch indeed
And gem of all the nation.
 <br><br><span class="character KING">KING CLAUDIUS</span>:
He made confession of you,<br>
And gave you such a masterly report<br>
For art and exercise in your defence<br>
And for your rapier most especially,<br>
That he cried out, 'twould be a sight indeed,<br>
If one could match you: the scrimers of their nation,<br>
He swore, had had neither motion, guard, nor eye,<br>
If you opposed them. Sir, this report of his<br>
Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy<br>
That he could nothing do but wish and beg<br>
Your sudden coming o'er, to play with him.<br>
Now, out of this,
<br><br><span class="character LAERTES">LAERTES</span>:
What out of this, my lord?
 <br><br><span class="character KING">KING CLAUDIUS</span>:
Laertes, was your father dear to you?<br>
Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,<br>
A face without a heart?
<br><br><span class="character LAERTES">LAERTES</span>:
Why ask you this?
 <br><br><span class="character KING">KING CLAUDIUS</span>:
Not that I think you did not love your father;<br>
But that I know love is begun by time;<br>
And that I see, in passages of proof,<br>
Time qualifies the spark and fire of it.<br>
There lives within the very flame of love<br>
A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;<br>
And nothing is at a like goodness still;<br>
For goodness, growing to a plurisy,<br>
Dies in his own too much: that we would do<br>
We should do when we would; for this 'would' changes<br>
And hath abatements and delays as many<br>
As there are tongues, are hands, are accidents;<br>
And then this 'should' is like a spendthrift sigh,<br>
That hurts by easing. But, to the quick o' the ulcer:<br>
Hamlet comes back: what would you undertake,<br>
To show yourself your father's son in deed<br>
More than in words?
<br><br><span class="character LAERTES">LAERTES</span>:
To cut his throat i' the church.
 <br><br><span class="character KING">KING CLAUDIUS</span>:
No place, indeed, should murder sanctuarize;<br>
Revenge should have no bounds. But, good Laertes,<br>
Will you do this, keep close within your chamber.<br>
Hamlet return'd shall know you are come home:<br>
We'll put on those shall praise your excellence<br>
And set a double varnish on the fame<br>
The Frenchman gave you, bring you in fine together<br>
And wager on your heads: he, being remiss,<br>
Most generous and free from all contriving,<br>
Will not peruse the foils;<br> so that, with ease,<br>
Or with a little shuffling, you may choose<br>
A sword unbated, and in a pass of practise<br>
Requite him for your father.
<br><br><span class="character LAERTES">LAERTES</span>:
I will do't:<br>
And, for that purpose, I'll anoint my sword.<br>
I bought an unction of a mountebank,<br>
So mortal that, but dip a knife in it,<br>
Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,<br>
Collected from all simples that have virtue<br>
Under the moon, can save the thing from death<br>
That is but scratch'd withal: I'll touch my point<br>
With this contagion, that, if I gall him slightly,<br>
It may be death.
 <br><br><span class="character KING">KING CLAUDIUS</span>:
Let's further think of this;<br>
Weigh what convenience both of time and means<br>
May fit us to our shape: if this should fail,<br>
And that our drift look through our bad performance,<br>
'Twere better not assay'd: therefore this project<br>
Should have a back or second, that might hold,<br>
If this should blast in proof. Soft! let me see:<br>
We'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings: I ha't.<br>
When in your motion you are hot and dry <br>
As make your bouts more violent to that end <br>
And that he calls for drink, I'll have prepared him<br>
A chalice for the nonce, whereon but sipping,<br>
If he by chance escape your venom'd stuck,<br>
Our purpose may hold there.

Drown'd! O, where?
<br><br><span class="character QUEEN">QUEEN GERTRUDE</span>:
There is a willow grows aslant a brook,<br>
That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream;<br>
There with fantastic garlands did she come<br>
Of crow-flowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples<br>
That liberal shepherds give a grosser name,<br>
But our cold maids do dead men's fingers call them:<br>
There, on the pendent boughs her coronet weeds<br>
Clambering to hang, an envious sliver broke;<br>
When down her weedy trophies and herself<br>
Fell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide;<br>
And, mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up:<br>
Which time she chanted snatches of old tunes;<br>
As one incapable of her own distress,<br>
Or like a creature native and indued<br>
Unto that element: but long it could not be<br>
Till that her garments, heavy with their drink,<br>
Pull'd the poor wretch from her melodious lay<br>
To muddy death.
<br><br><span class="character LAERTES">LAERTES</span>:
Alas, then, she is drown'd?
<br><br><span class="character QUEEN">QUEEN GERTRUDE</span>:
Drown'd, drown'd.

It is our trick;<br> nature her custom holds,<br>

ACT V<br>

SCENE I. A churchyard.<br>

Enter two Clowns, with spades,
First Clown
Is she to be buried in Christian burial that
wilfully seeks her own salvation?
Second Clown
I tell thee she is: and therefore make her grave
straight: the crowner hath sat on her, and finds it
Christian burial.
First Clown
How can that be, unless she drowned herself in her
own defence?
Second Clown
Why, 'tis found so.
First Clown
It must be 'se offendendo;<br>' it cannot be else. For
here lies the point: if I drown myself wittingly,
it argues an act: and an act hath three branches: it
is, to act, to do, to perform: argal, she drowned
herself wittingly.
Second Clown
Nay, but hear you, goodman delver,--
First Clown
Give me leave. Here lies the water;<br> good: here
stands the man;<br> good;<br> if the man go to this water,
and drown himself, it is, will he, nill he, he
goes,--mark you that;<br> but if the water come to him
and drown him, he drowns not himself: argal, he
that is not guilty of his own death shortens not his own life.
Second Clown
But is this law?
First Clown
Ay, marry, is't;<br> crowner's quest law.
Second Clown
Will you ha' the truth on't? If this had not been
a gentlewoman, she should have been buried out o'
Christian burial.
First Clown
Why, there thou say'st: and the more pity that
great folk should have countenance in this world to
drown or hang themselves, more than their even
Christian. Come, my spade. There is no ancient
gentleman but gardeners, ditchers, and grave-makers:
they hold up Adam's profession.
Second Clown
Was he a gentleman?
First Clown
He was the first that ever bore arms.
Second Clown
Why, he had none.
First Clown
What, art a heathen? How dost thou understand the
Scripture? The Scripture says 'Adam digged:'
could he dig without arms? I'll put another
question to thee: if thou answerest me not to the
purpose, confess thyself--
Second Clown
Go to.
First Clown
What is he that builds stronger than either the
mason, the shipwright, or the carpenter?
Second Clown
The gallows-maker;<br> for that frame outlives a
thousand tenants.
First Clown
I like thy wit well, in good faith: the gallows
does well;<br> but how does it well? it does well to
those that do in: now thou dost ill to say the
gallows is built stronger than the church: argal,
the gallows may do well to thee. To't again, come.
Second Clown
'Who builds stronger than a mason, a shipwright, or
a carpenter?'
First Clown
Ay, tell me that, and unyoke.
Second Clown
Marry, now I can tell.
First Clown
To't.
Second Clown
Mass, I cannot tell.
Enter <span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span> and <span class="character HORATIO">HORATIO</span>, at a distance

First Clown
Cudgel thy brains no more about it, for your dull
ass will not mend his pace with beating;<br> and, when
you are asked this question next, say 'a
grave-maker: 'the houses that he makes last till
doomsday. Go, get thee to Yaughan: fetch me a
stoup of liquor.
<br><span class="actionstyle brackets">Exit.</span> Second Clown

He digs and sings

In youth, when I did love, did love,
Methought it was very sweet,
To contract, O, the time, for, ah, my behove,
O, methought, there was nothing meet.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Has this fellow no feeling of his business, that he
sings at grave-making?
<br><br><span class="character HORATIO">HORATIO</span>:
Custom hath made it in him a property of easiness.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
'Tis e'en so: the hand of little employment hath
the daintier sense.
First Clown
[Sings]
But age, with his stealing steps,
Hath claw'd me in his clutch,
And hath shipped me intil the land,
As if I had never been such.
Throws up a skull

<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
That skull had a tongue in it, and could sing once:
how the knave jowls it to the ground, as if it were
Cain's jaw-bone, that did the first murder! It
might be the pate of a politician, which this ass
now o'er-reaches;<br> one that would circumvent God,
might it not?
<br><br><span class="character HORATIO">HORATIO</span>:
It might, my lord.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Or of a courtier;<br> which could say 'Good morrow,
sweet lord! How dost thou, good lord?' This might
be my lord such-a-one, that praised my lord
such-a-one's horse, when he meant to beg it;<br> might it not?
<br><br><span class="character HORATIO">HORATIO</span>:
Ay, my lord.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Why, e'en so: and now my Lady Worm's;<br> chapless, and
knocked about the mazzard with a sexton's spade:
here's fine revolution, an we had the trick to
see't. Did these bones cost no more the breeding,
but to play at loggats with 'em? mine ache to think on't.
First Clown
[Sings]
A pick-axe, and a spade, a spade,
For and a shrouding sheet:
O, a pit of clay for to be made
For such a guest is meet.
Throws up another skull

<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
There's another: why may not that be the skull of a
lawyer? Where be his quiddities now, his quillets,
his cases, his tenures, and his tricks? why does he
suffer this rude knave now to knock him about the
sconce with a dirty shovel, and will not tell him of
his action of battery? Hum! This fellow might be
in's time a great buyer of land, with his statutes,
his recognizances, his fines, his double vouchers,
his recoveries: is this the fine of his fines, and
the recovery of his recoveries, to have his fine
pate full of fine dirt? will his vouchers vouch him
no more of his purchases, and double ones too, than
the length and breadth of a pair of indentures? The
very conveyances of his lands will hardly lie in
this box;<br> and must the inheritor himself have no more, ha?
<br><br><span class="character HORATIO">HORATIO</span>:
Not a jot more, my lord.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Is not parchment made of sheepskins?
<br><br><span class="character HORATIO">HORATIO</span>:
Ay, my lord, and of calf-skins too.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
They are sheep and calves which seek out assurance
in that. I will speak to this fellow. Whose
grave's this, sirrah?
First Clown
Mine, sir.
Sings

O, a pit of clay for to be made
For such a guest is meet.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
I think it be thine, indeed;<br> for thou liest in't.
First Clown
You lie out on't, sir, and therefore it is not
yours: for my part, I do not lie in't, and yet it is mine.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
'Thou dost lie in't, to be in't and say it is thine:
'tis for the dead, not for the quick;<br> therefore thou liest.
First Clown
'Tis a quick lie, sir;<br> 'twill away gain, from me to
you.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
What man dost thou dig it for?
First Clown
For no man, sir.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
What woman, then?
First Clown
For none, neither.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Who is to be buried in't?
First Clown
One that was a woman, sir;<br> but, rest her soul, she's dead.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
How absolute the knave is! we must speak by the
card, or equivocation will undo us. By the Lord,
Horatio, these three years I have taken a note of
it;<br> the age is grown so picked that the toe of the
peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier, he
gaffs his kibe. How long hast thou been a
grave-maker?
First Clown
Of all the days i' the year, I came to't that day
that our last king Hamlet overcame Fortinbras.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
How long is that since?
First Clown
Cannot you tell that? every fool can tell that: it
was the very day that young Hamlet was born;<br> he that
is mad, and sent into England.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Ay, marry, why was he sent into England?
First Clown
Why, because he was mad: he shall recover his wits
there;<br> or, if he do not, it's no great matter there.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Why?
First Clown
'Twill, a not be seen in him there;<br> there the men
are as mad as he.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
How came he mad?
First Clown
Very strangely, they say.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
How strangely?
First Clown
Faith, e'en with losing his wits.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Upon what ground?
First Clown
Why, here in Denmark: I have been sexton here, man
and boy, thirty years.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
How long will a man lie i' the earth ere he rot?
First Clown
I' faith, if he be not rotten before he die--as we
have many pocky corses now-a-days, that will scarce
hold the laying in--he will last you some eight year
or nine year: a tanner will last you nine year.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Why he more than another?
First Clown
Why, sir, his hide is so tanned with his trade, that
he will keep out water a great while;<br> and your water
is a sore decayer of your whoreson dead body.
Here's a skull now;<br> this skull has lain in the earth
three and twenty years.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Whose was it?
First Clown
A whoreson mad fellow's it was: whose do you think it was?
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Nay, I know not.
First Clown
A pestilence on him for a mad rogue! a' poured a
flagon of Rhenish on my head once. This same skull,
sir, was Yorick's skull, the king's jester.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
This?
First Clown
E'en that.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Let me see.
Takes the skull

Alas, poor Yorick! I knew him, Horatio: a fellow
of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy: he hath
borne me on his back a thousand times;<br> and now, how
abhorred in my imagination it is! my gorge rims at
it. Here hung those lips that I have kissed I know
not how oft. Where be your gibes now? your
gambols? your songs? your flashes of merriment,
that were wont to set the table on a roar? Not one
now, to mock your own grinning? quite chap-fallen?
Now get you to my lady's chamber, and tell her, let
her paint an inch thick, to this favour she must
come;<br> make her laugh at that. Prithee, Horatio, tell
me one thing.
<br><br><span class="character HORATIO">HORATIO</span>:
What's that, my lord?
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Dost thou think Alexander looked o' this fashion i'
the earth?
<br><br><span class="character HORATIO">HORATIO</span>:
E'en so.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
And smelt so? pah!
Puts down the skull

<br><br><span class="character HORATIO">HORATIO</span>:
E'en so, my lord.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
To what base uses we may return, Horatio! Why may
not imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander,
till he find it stopping a bung-hole?
<br><br><span class="character HORATIO">HORATIO</span>:
'Twere to consider too curiously, to consider so.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
No, faith, not a jot;<br> but to follow him thither with
modesty enough, and likelihood to lead it: as
thus: Alexander died, Alexander was buried,
Alexander returneth into dust;<br> the dust is earth;<br> of
earth we make loam;<br> and why of that loam, whereto he
was converted, might they not stop a beer-barrel?
Imperious Caesar, dead and turn'd to clay,
Might stop a hole to keep the wind away:
O, that that earth, which kept the world in awe,
Should patch a wall to expel the winter flaw!
But soft! but soft! aside: here comes the king.
Enter Priest, & c. in procession;<br> the Corpse of <br><br><span class="character OPHELIA">OPHELIA</span>, <span class="character LAERTES">LAERTES</span> and Mourners following;<br>  <br><br><span class="character KING">KING CLAUDIUS</span>, <span class="character QUEEN">QUEEN GERTRUDE</span>, their trains, & c

The queen, the courtiers: who is this they follow?
And with such maimed rites? This doth betoken
The corse they follow did with desperate hand
Fordo its own life: 'twas of some estate.
Couch we awhile, and mark.
Retiring with <br><br><span class="character HORATIO">HORATIO</span>:

<br><br><span class="character LAERTES">LAERTES</span>:
What ceremony else?
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
That is Laertes,
A very noble youth: mark.
<br><br><span class="character LAERTES">LAERTES</span>:
What ceremony else?
First Priest
Her obsequies have been as far enlarged
As we have warrantise: her death was doubtful;<br>
And, but that great command o'ersways the order,
She should in ground unsanctified have lodged
Till the last trumpet: for charitable prayers,
Shards, flints and pebbles should be thrown on her;<br>
Yet here she is allow'd her virgin crants,
Her maiden strewments and the bringing home
Of bell and burial.
<br><br><span class="character LAERTES">LAERTES</span>:
Must there no more be done?
First Priest
No more be done:
We should profane the service of the dead
To sing a requiem and such rest to her
As to peace-parted souls.
<br><br><span class="character LAERTES">LAERTES</span>:
Lay her i' the earth:
And from her fair and unpolluted flesh
May violets spring! I tell thee, churlish priest,
A ministering angel shall my sister be,
When thou liest howling.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
What, the fair Ophelia!
<br><br><span class="character QUEEN">QUEEN GERTRUDE</span>:
Sweets to the sweet: farewell!
Scattering flowers

I hoped thou shouldst have been my Hamlet's wife;<br>
I thought thy bride-bed to have deck'd, sweet maid,
And not have strew'd thy grave.
<br><br><span class="character LAERTES">LAERTES</span>:
O, treble woe
Fall ten times treble on that cursed head,
Whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense
Deprived thee of! Hold off the earth awhile,
Till I have caught her once more in mine arms:
Leaps into the grave

Now pile your dust upon the quick and dead,
Till of this flat a mountain you have made,
To o'ertop old Pelion, or the skyish head
Of blue Olympus.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
[Advancing] What is he whose grief
Bears such an emphasis? whose phrase of sorrow
Conjures the wandering stars, and makes them stand
Like wonder-wounded hearers? This is I,
Hamlet the Dane.
Leaps into the grave

<br><br><span class="character LAERTES">LAERTES</span>:
The devil take thy soul!
Grappling with him

<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Thou pray'st not well.
I prithee, take thy fingers from my throat;<br>
For, though I am not splenitive and rash,
Yet have I something in me dangerous,
Which let thy wiseness fear: hold off thy hand.
 <br><br><span class="character KING">KING CLAUDIUS</span>:
Pluck them asunder.
<br><br><span class="character QUEEN">QUEEN GERTRUDE</span>:
Hamlet, Hamlet!
All
Gentlemen,--
<br><br><span class="character HORATIO">HORATIO</span>:
Good my lord, be quiet.
The Attendants part them, and they come out of the grave

<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Why I will fight with him upon this theme
Until my eyelids will no longer wag.
<br><br><span class="character QUEEN">QUEEN GERTRUDE</span>:
O my son, what theme?
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
I loved Ophelia: forty thousand brothers
Could not, with all their quantity of love,
Make up my sum. What wilt thou do for her?
 <br><br><span class="character KING">KING CLAUDIUS</span>:
O, he is mad, Laertes.
<br><br><span class="character QUEEN">QUEEN GERTRUDE</span>:
For love of God, forbear him.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
'Swounds, show me what thou'lt do:
Woo't weep? woo't fight? woo't fast? woo't tear thyself?
Woo't drink up eisel? eat a crocodile?
I'll do't. Dost thou come here to whine?
To outface me with leaping in her grave?
Be buried quick with her, and so will I:
And, if thou prate of mountains, let them throw
Millions of acres on us, till our ground,
Singeing his pate against the burning zone,
Make Ossa like a wart! Nay, an thou'lt mouth,
I'll rant as well as thou.
<br><br><span class="character QUEEN">QUEEN GERTRUDE</span>:
This is mere madness:
And thus awhile the fit will work on him;<br>
Anon, as patient as the female dove,
When that her golden couplets are disclosed,
His silence will sit drooping.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Hear you, sir;<br>
What is the reason that you use me thus?
I loved you ever: but it is no matter;<br>
Let Hercules himself do what he may,
The cat will mew and dog will have his day.
<br><span class="actionstyle brackets">Exit.</span>

 <br><br><span class="character KING">KING CLAUDIUS</span>:
I pray you, good Horatio, wait upon him.
<br><span class="actionstyle brackets">Exit.</span> <br><br><span class="character HORATIO">HORATIO</span>:

To <span class="character LAERTES">LAERTES</span>:

Strengthen your patience in our last night's speech;<br>
We'll put the matter to the present push.
Good Gertrude, set some watch over your son.
This grave shall have a living monument:
An hour of quiet shortly shall we see;<br>
Till then, in patience our proceeding be.
Exeunt

SCENE II. A hall in the castle.

Enter <span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span> and <span class="character HORATIO">HORATIO</span>:
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
So much for this, sir: now shall you see the other;<br>
You do remember all the circumstance?
<br><br><span class="character HORATIO">HORATIO</span>:
Remember it, my lord?
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting,
That would not let me sleep: methought I lay
Worse than the mutines in the bilboes. Rashly,
And praised be rashness for it, let us know,
Our indiscretion sometimes serves us well,
When our deep plots do pall: and that should teach us
There's a divinity that shapes our ends,
Rough-hew them how we will,--
<br><br><span class="character HORATIO">HORATIO</span>:
That is most certain.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Up from my cabin,
My sea-gown scarf'd about me, in the dark
Groped I to find out them;<br> had my desire.
Finger'd their packet, and in fine withdrew
To mine own room again;<br> making so bold,
My fears forgetting manners, to unseal
Their grand commission;<br> where I found, Horatio,--
O royal knavery!--an exact command,
Larded with many several sorts of reasons
Importing Denmark's health and England's too,
With, ho! such bugs and goblins in my life,
That, on the supervise, no leisure bated,
No, not to stay the grinding of the axe,
My head should be struck off.
<br><br><span class="character HORATIO">HORATIO</span>:
Is't possible?
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Here's the commission: read it at more leisure.
But wilt thou hear me how I did proceed?
<br><br><span class="character HORATIO">HORATIO</span>:
I beseech you.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Being thus be-netted round with villanies,--
Ere I could make a prologue to my brains,
They had begun the play--I sat me down,
Devised a new commission, wrote it fair:
I once did hold it, as our statists do,
A baseness to write fair and labour'd much
How to forget that learning, but, sir, now
It did me yeoman's service: wilt thou know
The effect of what I wrote?
<br><br><span class="character HORATIO">HORATIO</span>:
Ay, good my lord.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
An earnest conjuration from the king,
As England was his faithful tributary,
As love between them like the palm might flourish,
As peace should stiff her wheaten garland wear
And stand a comma 'tween their amities,
And many such-like 'As'es of great charge,
That, on the view and knowing of these contents,
Without debatement further, more or less,
He should the bearers put to sudden death,
Not shriving-time allow'd.
<br><br><span class="character HORATIO">HORATIO</span>:
How was this seal'd?
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Why, even in that was heaven ordinant.
I had my father's signet in my purse,
Which was the model of that Danish seal;<br>
Folded the writ up in form of the other,
Subscribed it, gave't the impression, placed it safely,
The changeling never known. Now, the next day
Was our sea-fight;<br> and what to this was sequent
Thou know'st already.
<br><br><span class="character HORATIO">HORATIO</span>:
So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to't.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Why, man, they did make love to this employment;<br>
They are not near my conscience;<br> their defeat
Does by their own insinuation grow:
'Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes
Between the pass and fell incensed points
Of mighty opposites.
<br><br><span class="character HORATIO">HORATIO</span>:
Why, what a king is this!
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Does it not, think'st thee, stand me now upon--
He that hath kill'd my king and whored my mother,
Popp'd in between the election and my hopes,
Thrown out his angle for my proper life,
And with such cozenage--is't not perfect conscience,
To quit him with this arm? and is't not to be damn'd,
To let this canker of our nature come
In further evil?
<br><br><span class="character HORATIO">HORATIO</span>:
It must be shortly known to him from England
What is the issue of the business there.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
It will be short: the interim is mine;<br>
And a man's life's no more than to say 'One.'
But I am very sorry, good Horatio,
That to Laertes I forgot myself;<br>
For, by the image of my cause, I see
The portraiture of his: I'll court his favours.
But, sure, the bravery of his grief did put me
Into a towering passion.
<br><br><span class="character HORATIO">HORATIO</span>:
Peace! who comes here?
Enter <span class="character OSRIC">OSRIC</span>:

<br><br><span class="character OSRIC">OSRIC</span>:
Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
I humbly thank you, sir. Dost know this water-fly?
<br><br><span class="character HORATIO">HORATIO</span>:
No, my good lord.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Thy state is the more gracious;<br> for 'tis a vice to
know him. He hath much land, and fertile: let a
beast be lord of beasts, and his crib shall stand at
the king's mess: 'tis a chough;<br> but, as I say,
spacious in the possession of dirt.
<br><br><span class="character OSRIC">OSRIC</span>:
Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, I
should impart a thing to you from his majesty.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
I will receive it, sir, with all diligence of
spirit. Put your bonnet to his right use;<br> 'tis for the head.
<br><br><span class="character OSRIC">OSRIC</span>:
I thank your lordship, it is very hot.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
No, believe me, 'tis very cold;<br> the wind is
northerly.
<br><br><span class="character OSRIC">OSRIC</span>:
It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my
complexion.
<br><br><span class="character OSRIC">OSRIC</span>:
Exceedingly, my lord;<br> it is very sultry,--as
'twere,--I cannot tell how. But, my lord, his
majesty bade me signify to you that he has laid a
great wager on your head: sir, this is the matter,--
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
I beseech you, remember--
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>: moves him to put on his hat

<br><br><span class="character OSRIC">OSRIC</span>:
Nay, good my lord;<br> for mine ease, in good faith.
Sir, here is newly come to court Laertes;<br> believe
me, an absolute gentleman, full of most excellent
differences, of very soft society and great showing:
indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he is the card or
calendar of gentry, for you shall find in him the
continent of what part a gentleman would see.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you;<br>
though, I know, to divide him inventorially would
dizzy the arithmetic of memory, and yet but yaw
neither, in respect of his quick sail. But, in the
verity of extolment, I take him to be a soul of
great article;<br> and his infusion of such dearth and
rareness, as, to make true diction of him, his
semblable is his mirror;<br> and who else would trace
him, his umbrage, nothing more.
<br><br><span class="character OSRIC">OSRIC</span>:
Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
The concernancy, sir? why do we wrap the gentleman
in our more rawer breath?
<br><br><span class="character OSRIC">OSRIC</span>:
Sir?
<br><br><span class="character HORATIO">HORATIO</span>:
Is't not possible to understand in another tongue?
You will do't, sir, really.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
What imports the nomination of this gentleman?
<br><br><span class="character OSRIC">OSRIC</span>:
Of Laertes?
<br><br><span class="character HORATIO">HORATIO</span>:
His purse is empty already;<br> all's golden words are spent.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Of him, sir.
<br><br><span class="character OSRIC">OSRIC</span>:
I know you are not ignorant--
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
I would you did, sir;<br> yet, in faith, if you did,
it would not much approve me. Well, sir?
<br><br><span class="character OSRIC">OSRIC</span>:
You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is--
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
I dare not confess that, lest I should compare with
him in excellence;<br> but, to know a man well, were to
know himself.
<br><br><span class="character OSRIC">OSRIC</span>:
I mean, sir, for his weapon;<br> but in the imputation
laid on him by them, in his meed he's unfellowed.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
What's his weapon?
<br><br><span class="character OSRIC">OSRIC</span>:
Rapier and dagger.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
That's two of his weapons: but, well.
<br><br><span class="character OSRIC">OSRIC</span>:
The king, sir, hath wagered with him six Barbary
horses: against the which he has imponed, as I take
it, six French rapiers and poniards, with their
assigns, as girdle, hangers, and so: three of the
carriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy, very
responsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages,
and of very liberal conceit.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
What call you the carriages?
<br><br><span class="character HORATIO">HORATIO</span>:
I knew you must be edified by the margent ere you had done.
<br><br><span class="character OSRIC">OSRIC</span>:
The carriages, sir, are the hangers.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
The phrase would be more german to the matter, if we
could carry cannon by our sides: I would it might
be hangers till then. But, on: six Barbary horses
against six French swords, their assigns, and three
liberal-conceited carriages;<br> that's the French bet
against the Danish. Why is this 'imponed,' as you call it?
<br><br><span class="character OSRIC">OSRIC</span>:
The king, sir, hath laid, that in a dozen passes
between yourself and him, he shall not exceed you
three hits: he hath laid on twelve for nine;<br> and it
would come to immediate trial, if your lordship
would vouchsafe the answer.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
How if I answer 'no'?
<br><br><span class="character OSRIC">OSRIC</span>:
I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Sir, I will walk here in the hall: if it please his
majesty, 'tis the breathing time of day with me;<br> let
the foils be brought, the gentleman willing, and the
king hold his purpose, I will win for him an I can;<br>
if not, I will gain nothing but my shame and the odd hits.
<br><br><span class="character OSRIC">OSRIC</span>:
Shall I re-deliver you e'en so?
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
To this effect, sir;<br> after what flourish your nature will.
<br><br><span class="character OSRIC">OSRIC</span>:
I commend my duty to your lordship.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Yours, yours.
<br><span class="actionstyle brackets">Exit.</span> <br><br><span class="character OSRIC">OSRIC</span>:

He does well to commend it himself;<br> there are no
tongues else for's turn.
<br><br><span class="character HORATIO">HORATIO</span>:
This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
He did comply with his dug, before he sucked it.
Thus has he--and many more of the same bevy that I
know the dressy age dotes on--only got the tune of
the time and outward habit of encounter;<br> a kind of
yesty collection, which carries them through and
through the most fond and winnowed opinions;<br> and do
but blow them to their trial, the bubbles are out.
Enter a Lord

Lord
My lord, his majesty commended him to you by young
Osric, who brings back to him that you attend him in
the hall: he sends to know if your pleasure hold to
play with Laertes, or that you will take longer time.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
I am constant to my purpose;<br> they follow the king's
pleasure: if his fitness speaks, mine is ready;<br> now
or whensoever, provided I be so able as now.
Lord
The king and queen and all are coming down.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
In happy time.
Lord
The queen desires you to use some gentle
entertainment to Laertes before you fall to play.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
She well instructs me.
<br><span class="actionstyle brackets">Exit.</span> Lord

<br><br><span class="character HORATIO">HORATIO</span>:
You will lose this wager, my lord.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
I do not think so: since he went into France, I
have been in continual practise: I shall win at the
odds. But thou wouldst not think how ill all's here
about my heart: but it is no matter.
<br><br><span class="character HORATIO">HORATIO</span>:
Nay, good my lord,--
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
It is but foolery;<br> but it is such a kind of
gain-giving, as would perhaps trouble a woman.
<br><br><span class="character HORATIO">HORATIO</span>:
If your mind dislike any thing, obey it: I will
forestall their repair hither, and say you are not
fit.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Not a whit, we defy augury: there's a special
providence in the fall of a sparrow. If it be now,
'tis not to come;<br> if it be not to come, it will be
now;<br> if it be not now, yet it will come: the
readiness is all: since no man has aught of what he
leaves, what is't to leave betimes?
<br><span class="actionstyle brackets">Enter <span class="character KING">KING CLAUDIUS</span>, <span class="character QUEEN">QUEEN GERTRUDE</span>, <span class="character LAERTES">LAERTES</span>, Lords, <span class="character OSRIC">OSRIC</span>, and Attendants with foils</span>.

 <br><br><span class="character KING">KING CLAUDIUS</span>:
Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me.
 <br><br><span class="character KING">KING CLAUDIUS</span>: puts <br><br><span class="character LAERTES">LAERTES</span>:' hand into <br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:'s

<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Give me your pardon, sir: I've done you wrong;<br>
But pardon't, as you are a gentleman.
This presence knows,
And you must needs have heard, how I am punish'd
With sore distraction. What I have done,
That might your nature, honour and exception
Roughly awake, I here proclaim was madness.
Was't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes? Never Hamlet:
If Hamlet from himself be ta'en away,
And when he's not himself does wrong Laertes,
Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it.
Who does it, then? His madness: if't be so,
Hamlet is of the faction that is wrong'd;<br>
His madness is poor Hamlet's enemy.
Sir, in this audience,
Let my disclaiming from a purposed evil
Free me so far in your most generous thoughts,
That I have shot mine arrow o'er the house,
And hurt my brother.
<br><br><span class="character LAERTES">LAERTES</span>:
I am satisfied in nature,
Whose motive, in this case, should stir me most
To my revenge: but in my terms of honour
I stand aloof;<br> and will no reconcilement,
Till by some elder masters, of known honour,
I have a voice and precedent of peace,
To keep my name ungored. But till that time,
I do receive your offer'd love like love,
And will not wrong it.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
I embrace it freely;<br>
And will this brother's wager frankly play.
Give us the foils. Come on.
<br><br><span class="character LAERTES">LAERTES</span>:
Come, one for me.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
I'll be your foil, Laertes: in mine ignorance
Your skill shall, like a star i' the darkest night,
Stick fiery off indeed.
<br><br><span class="character LAERTES">LAERTES</span>:
You mock me, sir.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
No, by this hand.
 <br><br><span class="character KING">KING CLAUDIUS</span>:
Give them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet,
You know the wager?
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Very well, my lord
Your grace hath laid the odds o' the weaker side.
 <br><br><span class="character KING">KING CLAUDIUS</span>:
I do not fear it;<br> I have seen you both:
But since he is better'd, we have therefore odds.
<br><br><span class="character LAERTES">LAERTES</span>:
This is too heavy, let me see another.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
This likes me well. These foils have all a length?
They prepare to play

<br><br><span class="character OSRIC">OSRIC</span>:
Ay, my good lord.
 <br><br><span class="character KING">KING CLAUDIUS</span>:
Set me the stoops of wine upon that table.
If Hamlet give the first or second hit,
Or quit in answer of the third exchange,
Let all the battlements their ordnance fire:
The king shall drink to Hamlet's better breath;<br>
And in the cup an union shall he throw,
Richer than that which four successive kings
In Denmark's crown have worn. Give me the cups;<br>
And let the kettle to the trumpet speak,
The trumpet to the cannoneer without,
The cannons to the heavens, the heavens to earth,
'Now the king dunks to Hamlet.' Come, begin:
And you, the judges, bear a wary eye.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Come on, sir.
<br><br><span class="character LAERTES">LAERTES</span>:
Come, my lord.
<br><span class="actionstyle brackets">They play</span>.

<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
One.
<br><br><span class="character LAERTES">LAERTES</span>:
No.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Judgment.
<br><br><span class="character OSRIC">OSRIC</span>:
A hit, a very palpable hit.
<br><br><span class="character LAERTES">LAERTES</span>:
Well;<br> again.
 <br><br><span class="character KING">KING CLAUDIUS</span>:
Stay;<br> give me drink. Hamlet, this pearl is thine;<br>
Here's to thy health.
Trumpets sound, and cannon shot off within

Give him the cup.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
I'll play this bout first;<br> set it by awhile. Come.
<br><span class="actionstyle brackets">They play</span>.

Another hit;<br> what say you?
<br><br><span class="character LAERTES">LAERTES</span>:
A touch, a touch, I do confess.
 <br><br><span class="character KING">KING CLAUDIUS</span>:
Our son shall win.
<br><br><span class="character QUEEN">QUEEN GERTRUDE</span>:
He's fat, and scant of breath.
Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows;<br>
The queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Good madam!
 <br><br><span class="character KING">KING CLAUDIUS</span>:
Gertrude, do not drink.
<br><br><span class="character QUEEN">QUEEN GERTRUDE</span>:
I will, my lord;<br> I pray you, pardon me.
 <br><br><span class="character KING">KING CLAUDIUS</span>:
<span class="actionstyle brackets">[Aside]</span> It is the poison'd cup: it is too late.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
I dare not drink yet, madam;<br> by and by.
<br><br><span class="character QUEEN">QUEEN GERTRUDE</span>:
Come, let me wipe thy face.
<br><br><span class="character LAERTES">LAERTES</span>:
My lord, I'll hit him now.
 <br><br><span class="character KING">KING CLAUDIUS</span>:
I do not think't.
<br><br><span class="character LAERTES">LAERTES</span>:
<span class="actionstyle brackets">[Aside]</span> And yet 'tis almost 'gainst my conscience.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Come, for the third, Laertes: you but dally;<br>
I pray you, pass with your best violence;<br>
I am afeard you make a wanton of me.
<br><br><span class="character LAERTES">LAERTES</span>:
Say you so? come on.
<br><span class="actionstyle brackets">They play</span>.

<br><br><span class="character OSRIC">OSRIC</span>:

<br><br><span class="character OSRIC">OSRIC</span>:
How is't, Laertes?
<br><br><span class="character LAERTES">LAERTES</span>:
Why, as a woodcock to mine own springe, Osric;<br>
I am justly kill'd with mine own treachery.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
How does the queen?
 <br><br><span class="character KING">KING CLAUDIUS</span>:
She swounds to see them bleed.
<br><br><span class="character QUEEN">QUEEN GERTRUDE</span>:
No, no, the drink, the drink,--O my dear Hamlet,--
The drink, the drink! I am poison'd.

It is here, Hamlet: Hamlet, thou art slain;<br>
No medicine in the world can do thee good;<br>
In thee there is not half an hour of life;<br>
The treacherous instrument is in thy hand,
Unbated and envenom'd: the foul practise
Hath turn'd itself on me lo, here I lie,
Never to rise again: thy mother's poison'd:
I can no more: the king, the king's to blame.

<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
Heaven make thee free of it! I follow thee.
I am dead, Horatio. Wretched queen, adieu!
You that look pale and tremble at this chance,
That are but mutes or audience to this act,
Had I but time--as this fell sergeant, death,
Is strict in his arrest--O, I could tell you--
But let it be. Horatio, I am dead;<br>
Thou livest;<br> report me and my cause aright
To the unsatisfied.
<br><br><span class="character HORATIO">HORATIO</span>:
Never believe it:
I am more an antique Roman than a Dane:
Here's yet some liquor left.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
As thou'rt a man,
Give me the cup: let go;<br> by heaven, I'll have't.
O good Horatio, what a wounded name,
Things standing thus unknown, shall live behind me!
If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart
Absent thee from felicity awhile,
And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain,
To tell my story.
March afar off, and shot within

What warlike noise is this?
<br><br><span class="character OSRIC">OSRIC</span>:
Young Fortinbras, with conquest come from Poland,
To the ambassadors of England gives
This warlike volley.
<br><br><span class="character HAMLET">HAMLET</span>:
O, I die, Horatio;<br>
The potent poison quite o'er-crows my spirit:
I cannot live to hear the news from England;<br>
But I do prophesy the election lights
On Fortinbras: he has my dying voice;<br>
So tell him, with the occurrents, more and less,
Which have solicited. The rest is silence.
<br><span class="actionstyle brackets">Dies</span>.

<br><br><span class="character HORATIO">HORATIO</span>:
Now cracks a noble heart. Good night sweet prince:
And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!
Why does the drum come hither?
March within

<br><span class="actionstyle brackets">Enter <span class="character FORTINBRAS">FORTINBRAS</span>, the English Ambassadors, and others</span>.

<br><br><span class="character FORTINBRAS">PRINCE FORTINBRAS</span>:
Where is this sight?
<br><br><span class="character HORATIO">HORATIO</span>:
What is it ye would see?
If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.
<br><br><span class="character FORTINBRAS">PRINCE FORTINBRAS</span>:
This quarry cries on havoc. O proud death,
What feast is toward in thine eternal cell,
That thou so many princes at a shot
So bloodily hast struck?
First Ambassador
The sight is dismal;<br>
And our affairs from England come too late:
The ears are senseless that should give us hearing,
To tell him his commandment is fulfill'd,
That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead:
Where should we have our thanks?
<br><br><span class="character HORATIO">HORATIO</span>:
Not from his mouth,
Had it the ability of life to thank you:
He never gave commandment for their death.
But since, so jump upon this bloody question,
You from the Polack wars, and you from England,
Are here arrived give order that these bodies
High on a stage be placed to the view;<br>
And let me speak to the yet unknowing world
How these things came about: so shall you hear
Of carnal, bloody, and unnatural acts,
Of accidental judgments, casual slaughters,
Of deaths put on by cunning and forced cause,
And, in this upshot, purposes mistook
Fall'n on the inventors' reads: all this can I
Truly deliver.
<br><br><span class="character FORTINBRAS">PRINCE FORTINBRAS</span>:
Let us haste to hear it,
And call the noblest to the audience.
For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune:
I have some rights of memory in this kingdom,
Which now to claim my vantage doth invite me.
<br><br><span class="character HORATIO">HORATIO</span>:
Of that I shall have also cause to speak,
And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more;<br>
But let this same be presently perform'd,
Even while men's minds are wild;<br> lest more mischance
On plots and errors, happen.
<br><!-- <span class="character ham_anchor" id="ham_anchor3"> -->PRINCE FORTINBRAS<!-- </span> -->:
Let four captains
Bear Hamlet, like a soldier, to the stage;<br>
For he was likely, had he been put on,
To have proved most royally: and, for his passage,
The soldiers' music and the rites of war
Speak loudly for him.
Take up the bodies: such a sight as this
Becomes the field, but here shows much amiss.
Go, bid the soldiers shoot.
